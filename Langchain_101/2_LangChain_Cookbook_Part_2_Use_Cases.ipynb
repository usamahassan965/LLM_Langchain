        "1. **Integration** - Bring external data, such as your files, other applications, and api data, to your LLMs\n",

        "### **Why LangChain?**\n",
        "1. **Components** - LangChain makes it easy to swap out abstractions and components necessary to work with language models.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Customized Chains** - LangChain provides out of the box support for using and customizing 'chains' - a series of actions strung together.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Speed 🚢** - This team ships insanely fast. You'll be up to date with the latest LLM features.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Community 👥** - Wonderful [discord](https://discord.gg/6adMQxSpJS) and community support, meet ups, hackathons, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Though LLMs can be straightforward (text-in, text-out) you'll quickly run into friction points that LangChain helps with once you develop more complicated applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Main Use Cases**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Summarization** - Express the most important facts about a body of text or chat interaction\n",
        "* **Question and Answering Over Documents** - Use information held within documents to answer questions or query\n",
        "* **Extraction** - Pull structured data from a body of text or an user query\n",
        "* **Evaluation** - Understand the quality of output from your application\n",
        "* **Querying Tabular Data** - Pull data from databases or other tabular source\n",
        "* **Code Understanding** - Reason about and digest code\n",
        "* **Interacting with APIs** - Query APIs and interact with the outside world\n",
        "* **Chatbots** - A framework to have a back and forth interaction with a user combined with memory in a chat interface\n",
        "* **Agents** - Use LLMs to make decisions about what to do next. Enable these decisions with tools.\n",

        "* We use the default models throughout the notebook, at the time of writing they were davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo. You would no doubt get better results with GPT4\n",
