            " page_content='at fifty-six the oldest member of our group, was an anesthesiologist from\\nBrisbane who‚Äôd taken up climbing after retiring from the Australian\\narmy. Frank Fischbeck, fifty-three, a dapper, genteel publisher from\\nHong Kong, had attempted Everest three times with one of Hall‚Äôs\\ncompetitors; in 1994 he‚Äôd gotten all the way to the South Summit, just\\n330 vertical feet below the top. Doug Hansen, forty-six, was an\\nAmerican postal worker who‚Äôd gone to Everest with Hall in 1995 and,\\nlike Fischbeck, had reached the South Summit before turning back.\\nI wasn‚Äôt sure what to make of my fellow clients. In outlook and\\nexperience they were nothing like the hard-core climbers with whom I\\nusually went into the mountains. But they seemed like nice, decent folks,\\nand there wasn‚Äôt a certifiable asshole in the entire group‚Äîat least not\\none who was showing his true colors at this early stage of the\\nproceedings. Nevertheless, I didn‚Äôt have much in common with \\nany of\\nmy teammates except Doug. A wiry, hard-partying man with a\\nprematurely weathered face that brought to mind an old football, he‚Äôd\\nbeen a postal worker for more than twenty-seven years. He told me that\\nhe‚Äôd paid for the trip by working the night shift and doing construction\\njobs by day. Because I‚Äôd earned my living as a carpenter for eight years\\nbefore becoming a writer‚Äîand because the tax bracket we shared set us\\nconspicuously apart from the other clients‚ÄîI already felt comfortable\\naround Doug in a way that I didn‚Äôt with the others.\\nFor the most part I attributed my growing unease to the fact that I‚Äôd\\nnever climbed as a member of such a large group‚Äîa group of completestrangers, no less. Aside from one Alaska trip I‚Äôd done twenty-one years\\nearlier, all my previous expeditions had been undertaken with one or\\ntwo trusted friends, or alone.\\nIn climbing, having confidence in your partners is no small concern.\\nOne climber‚Äôs actions can affect the welfare of the entire team. The\\nconsequences of a poorly tied knot, a stumble, a dislodged rock, or some\\nother careless deed are as likely to be felt by the perpetrator‚Äôs colleagues\\nas by the perpetrator. Hence it‚Äôs not surprising that climbers are\\ntypically wary of joining forces with those whose bona fides are\\nunknown to them.\\nBut trust in one‚Äôs partners is a luxury denied those who sign on as\\nclients on a guided ascent; one must put one‚Äôs faith in the guide instead.\\nAs the helicopter \\ndroned toward Lukla, I suspected that each of my\\nteammates hoped as fervently as I that Hall had been careful to weed out\\nclients of dubious ability, and would have the means to protect each of\\nus from one another‚Äôs shortcomings.\\n*\\n It took Bass four years to ascend the Seven Summits.F\\nFOUR\\nPHAKDING\\nMARCH 31, 1996 ‚Ä¢ 9,186 FEET\\nFor those who didn‚Äôt dally, our daily treks ended early in the afternoon, but rarely before the heat\\nand aching feet forced us to ask each passing Sherpa, ‚ÄúHow much farther to camp?‚Äù The reply, we\\nsoon were to discover, was invariable: ‚ÄúOnly two mile more, Sah‚Äôb.‚Ä¶‚Äù\\nEvenings were peaceful, smoke settling in the quiet air to soften the dusk, lights twinkling on the\\nridge we would camp on tomorrow, clouds dimming the outline of our pass for the day after.\\nGrowing excitement lured my thoughts again and again to the West Ridge.‚Ä¶\\nThere was loneliness, too, as the sun set, but only rarely now did doubts return. Then I felt\\nsinkingly as if my whole life lay behind me. Once on the mountain I knew (or trusted) that this\\nwould give way to total absorption with the task at hand. But at times I wondered if I had not\\ncome a long way only to find that what I really sought was something I had left behind\\n.\\nThomas F. Hornbein    \\nEverest: The West Ridge\\nrom Lukla the way to Everest led north through the\\ncrepuscular gorge of the Dudh Kosi, an icy, boulder-choked\\nriver that churned with glacial runoff. We spent the first night of our\\ntrek in the hamlet of Phakding, a collection of a half dozen homes and\\nlodges crowded onto a shelf of level ground on a slope above the river.\\nThe air took on a wintry sting as night fell, and in the morning, as I\\nheaded up the trail, a glaze of frost sparkled from the rhododendron\\nleaves. But the Everest region lies at 28 degrees north latitude‚Äîjust\\nbeyond the tropics‚Äîand as soon as the sun rose high enough to\\npenetrate the depths of the canyon the temperature soared. By noon,\\nafter we‚Äôd crossed a wobbly footbridge suspended high over the river‚Äî\\nthe fourth river crossing of the day‚Äîrivulets of sweat were dripping off\\nmy chin, and I peeled down to shorts and a T-shirt.\\nBeyond the bridge, the dirt path abandoned the banks of the Dudh\\nKosi and zigzagged up the steep canyon wall, ascending througharomatic stands of pine. The spectacularly fluted ice pinnacles of\\nThamserku and Kusum Kangru pierced the sky more than two vertical\\nmiles above. It was magnificent country, as topographically imposing as\\nany landscape on earth, but it wasn‚Äôt wilderness, and hadn‚Äôt been for\\nhundreds of years.\\nEvery scrap of arable land had been terraced and planted with barley,\\nbitter buckwheat, or potatoes. Strings of prayer flags were strung across\\nthe hill-sides, \\nand ancient Buddhist \\nchortens\\n*\\n and walls of exquisitely\\ncarved \\nmani\\n‚Ä†\\n stones stood sentinel over even the highest passes. As I\\nmade my way up from the river, the trail was clogged with trekkers,\\nyak\\n‚Ä°\\n trains, red-robed monks, and barefoot Sherpas straining beneath\\nback-wrenching loads of firewood and kerosene and soda pop.\\nNinety minutes above the river, I crested a broad ridge, passed a\\nmatrix of rock-walled yak corrals, and abruptly found myself in\\ndowntown Namche Bazaar, the social and commercial hub of Sherpa\\nsociety. Situated 11,300 feet above sea level, Namche occupies a huge,\\ntilting bowl proportioned like a giant satellite television dish, midway up\\na precipitous mountainside. More than a hundred buildings nestled\\ndramatically on the rocky slope, linked by a maze of narrow paths and\\ncatwalks. Near the lower edge of town I located the Khumbu Lodge,\\npushed \\naside the blanket that functioned as a front door, and found my\\nteammates drinking lemon tea around a table in the corner.\\nWhen I approached, Rob Hall introduced me to Mike Groom, the\\nexpedition‚Äôs third guide. A thirty-three-year-old Australian with carrot-\\ncolored hair and the lean build of a marathon runner, Groom was a\\nBrisbane plumber who worked as a guide only occasionally. In 1987,\\nforced to spend a night in the open while descending from the 28,169-\\nfoot summit of Kanchenjunga, he froze his feet and had to have all his\\ntoes amputated. This setback had not put a damper on his Himalayan\\ncareer, however: he‚Äôd gone on to climb K2, Lhotse, Cho Oyu, Ama\\nDablam, and, in 1993, Everest without supplementary oxygen. An\\nexceedingly calm, circumspect man, Groom was pleasant company but\\nseldom spoke unless spoken to and replied to questions tersely, in a\\nbarely audible voice.\\nDinner conversation was dominated by the three clients who were\\ndoctors‚ÄîStuart, John, and especially Beck, a pattern that would berepeated for much of the expedition. Fortunately, both John and Beck\\nwere wickedly funny and had the group in stitches. Beck, however, was\\nin the habit of turning his monologues into scathing, Limbaughesque\\nrants against bed-wetting liberals, and at one point that evening I made\\nthe mistake of disagreeing with him: in response to one of his comments\\nI suggested that raising the minimum wage seemed like a wise and\\nnecessary policy. Well informed and a very skilled debater, Beck made\\nhash out of my fumbling avowal, and I lacked the where withal to rebut\\nhim. All I could do was to sit on my hands, tongue-tied and steaming.\\nAs he continued to hold forth in his swampy East Texas drawl about\\nthe numerous follies of the welfare state, I got up and left the table to\\navoid humiliating myself further. When I returned to the dining room, I\\napproached the proprietress, Ngawang Doka, to ask for a beer. A small,\\ngraceful Sherpani, she was in the midst of taking an order from a group\\nof American trekkers. ‚ÄúWe hungry,‚Äù a ruddy-cheeked man announced to\\nher in overly loud pidgin, miming the act of eating. ‚ÄúWant eat po-ta-toes.\\nYak burger. Co-ca Co-la. You have?‚Äù\\n‚ÄúWould you like to see the menu?‚Äù Ngawang Doka replied in clear,\\nsparkling English that carried a hint of a Canadian accent. ‚ÄúOur selection\\nis actually quite large. And I believe there is still some freshly baked\\napple pie available, if that interests you, for dessert.‚Äù\\nThe American trekker, unable to comprehend that this brown-skinned\\nwoman of the hills was addressing him in perfectly enunciated King‚Äôs\\nEnglish, continued to employ his comical pidgin argot: ‚ÄúMen-u. Good,\\ngood. Yes, yes, we like see men-u.‚Äù\\nSherpas remain an enigma to most foreigners, who tend to regard\\nthem through a romantic scrim. People unfamiliar with the demography\\nof the \\nHimalaya often assume that all Nepalese are Sherpas, when in fact\\nthere are no more than 20,000 Sherpas in all of Nepal, a nation the size\\nof North Carolina that has some 20 million residents and more than fifty\\ndistinct ethnic groups. Sherpas are a mountain people, devoutly\\nBuddhist, whose forebears migrated south from Tibet four or five\\ncenturies ago. There are Sherpa villages scattered throughout the\\nHimalaya of eastern Nepal, and sizable Sherpa communities can be\\nfound in Sikkim and Darjeeling, India, but the heart of Sherpa country is\\nthe Khumbu, a handful of valleys draining the southern slopes of MountEverest‚Äîa small, astonishingly rugged region completely devoid of\\nroads, cars, or wheeled vehicles of any kind.\\nFarming is difficult in the high, cold, steep-walled valleys, so the\\ntraditional Sherpa economy revolved around trading between Tibet and\\nIndia, and herding yaks. Then, in 1921, the British embarked on their\\nfirst expedition to Everest, and their decision to engage Sherpas as\\nhelpers sparked a transformation of Sherpa culture.\\nBecause the Kingdom of Nepal kept its borders closed until 1949, the'\n",

His camp, distinguished\\nby a huge Starbucks Coffee promotional banner suspended from a house-\\nsize block of granite, was situated just five minutes‚Äô walk down the\\nglacier from ours.\\nThe sundry men and women who make careers out of scaling the\\nworld‚Äôs highest peaks constitute a \\nsmall, ingrown club. Fischer and Hall\\nwere business rivals, but as prominent members of the high-altitude\\nfraternity their paths frequently crossed, and on a certain level they\\nconsidered themselves friends. Fischer and Hall met in the 1980s in the\\nRussian Pamir, and they subsequently spent considerable time in each\\nother‚Äôs company in 1989 and 1994 on Everest. They had firm plans to\\njoin forces and attempt Manaslu‚Äîa difficult 26,781-foot peak in central\\nNepal‚Äîimmediately after guiding their respective clients up Everest in\\n1996.\\nThe bond between Fischer and Hall had been cemented back in 1992,\\nwhen they had bumped into each other on K2, the world‚Äôs second-\\nhighest mountain. Hall was attempting the peak with his \\ncompa√±ero\\n and\\nbusiness partner, Gary Ball; Fischer was climbing with an elite American\\nclimber named Ed Viesturs. On their way down from the summit in a\\nhowling storm, Fischer, Viesturs, and a third American, Charlie Mace,\\nencountered Hall struggling to cope with a barely conscious Ball, who\\nhad been stricken with a life-threatening case of altitude sickness and\\nwas unable to move under his own power. Fischer, Viesturs, and Mace\\nhelped drag Ball down the avalanche-swept lower slopes of the mountain\\nthrough the blizzard, saving his life. (A year later Ball would die of a\\nsimilar ailment on the slopes of Dhaulagiri.)\\nFischer, forty, was a strapping, gregarious man with a blond ponytail\\nand a surfeit of manic energy. As a fourteen-year-old schoolboy in\\nBasking Ridge, \\nNew Jersey, he had chanced upon a television program\\nabout mountaineering and was enthralled. The next summer he traveled\\nto Wyoming and enrolled in an Outward Bound‚Äìstyle wilderness course\\nrun by the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS). As soon as hegraduated from high school he moved west permanently, found seasonal\\nemployment as a NOLS instructor, placed climbing at the center of his\\ncosmos, and never looked back.\\nWhen Fischer was eighteen and working at NOLS, he fell in love with\\na student in his course named Jean Price. They were married seven years\\nlater, settled in Seattle, and had two children, Andy and Katie Rose (who\\nwere nine and five, respectively, when Scott went to Everest in 1996).\\nPrice earned her commercial pilot‚Äôs license and became a captain for\\nAlaska Airlines‚Äîa prestigious, well-paying career that allowed Fischer to\\nclimb full-time. Her income also permitted Fischer to launch Mountain\\nMadness in 1984.\\nIf the name of Hall‚Äôs business, Adventure Consultants, mirrored his\\nmethodical, fastidious approach to climbing, Mountain Madness was an\\neven more accurate reflection of Scott‚Äôs personal style. By his early\\ntwenties, he had developed a reputation for a harrowing, damn-the-\\ntorpedoes approach to ascent. Throughout his climbing career, but\\nespecially during those early years, he survived a number of frightening\\nmishaps that by all rights should have killed him.\\nOn at least two occasions while rock climbing‚Äîonce in Wyoming,\\nanother time in Yosemite‚Äîhe crashed into the ground from more than\\n80 feet up. While working as a junior instructor on a NOLS course in the\\nWind River Range he plunged 70 feet, unroped, to the bottom of a\\ncrevasse on the Din-woody Glacier. Perhaps his most infamous tumble,\\nthough, occurred when he was a novice ice climber: despite his\\ninexperience, Fischer had decided to attempt the coveted first ascent of a\\ndifficult frozen cascade called Bridal Veil Falls, in Utah‚Äôs Provo Canyon.\\nRacing two expert climbers up the ice, Fischer lost his purchase 100 feet\\noff the deck and plummeted to the ground.\\nTo the amazement of those who witnessed the incident, he picked\\nhimself up and walked away with relatively minor injuries. During his\\nlong plunge to earth, however, the tubular pick of an ice tool impaled\\nhis calf and came out the other side. When the hollow pick was\\nextracted, it removed a core sample of tissue, leaving a hole in his leg\\nbig enough to stick a pencil through. After being discharged from the\\nemergency room at a local hospital, Fischer saw no reason to waste his\\nlimited supply of cash on additional medical treatment, so he climbedfor the next six months with an open, suppurating wound. Fifteen years\\nlater he proudly showed me the permanent scar inflicted by that fall: a\\npair of shiny, dime-size marks bracketing his Achilles tendon.\\n‚ÄúScott would push himself beyond any physical \\nlimitation,‚Äù recalls\\nDon Peterson, a renowned American climber who met Fischer soon after\\nhis slip from Bridal Veil Falls. Peterson became something of a mentor to\\nFischer and climbed with him intermittently over the next two decades.\\n‚ÄúHis will was astonishing. It didn‚Äôt matter how much pain he was in‚Äîhe\\nwould ignore it and keep going. He wasn‚Äôt the kind of guy who would\\nturn around because he had a sore foot.\\n‚ÄúScott had this burning ambition to be a great climber, to be one of\\nthe best in the world. I remember at the NOLS headquarters there was a\\ncrude sort of gym. Scott would go into that room and regularly work out\\nso hard that he threw up. Regularly. One doesn‚Äôt meet many people with\\nthat kind of drive.‚Äù\\nPeople were drawn to Fischer‚Äôs energy and generosity, his absence of\\nguile, his almost childlike enthusiasm. Raw and emotional, disinclined\\ntoward introspection, he had the kind of gregarious, magnetic\\npersonality that instantly won him friends for life; hundreds of\\nindividuals‚Äîincluding some he‚Äôd met just once or twice‚Äîconsidered\\nhim a bosom buddy. He was also strikingly handsome with a\\nbodybuilder‚Äôs physique and the chiseled features of a movie star. Among\\nthose attracted to him were not a few members of the opposite sex, and\\nhe wasn‚Äôt immune to the attention.\\nA man of rampant appetites, Fischer smoked a lot of cannabis\\n(although not while working) and drank more than was healthy. A back\\nroom at the \\nMountain Madness office functioned as a sort of secret\\nclubhouse for Scott: after putting his kids to bed he liked to retire there\\nwith his pals to pass around a pipe and look at slides of their brave\\ndeeds on the heights.\\nDuring the 1980s Fischer made a number of impressive ascents that\\nearned him a modicum of local renown, but celebrity in the world\\nclimbing community eluded him. Despite his concerted efforts, he was\\nunable to land a lucrative commercial sponsorship of the sort enjoyed by\\nsome of his more famous peers. He worried that some of these topclimbers didn‚Äôt respect him.\\n‚ÄúRecognition was important to Scott,‚Äù says Jane Bromet, his publicist,\\nconfidant, and occasional training partner, who accompanied the\\nMountain Madness expedition to Base Camp to file Internet reports for\\nOutside Online. ‚ÄúHe ached for it. He had a vulnerable side that most\\npeople didn‚Äôt see; it really bothered him that he wasn‚Äôt more widely\\nrespected as a butt-kicking climber. He felt slighted, and it hurt.‚Äù\\nBy the time Fischer left for Nepal in the spring of 1996, he‚Äôd begun to\\ngarner more of the recognition that he thought was his due. Much of it\\ncame in the wake of his 1994 ascent of Everest, accomplished without\\nsupplemental oxygen. Christened the Sagarmatha Environmental\\nExpedition, Fischer‚Äôs team removed 5,000 pounds of trash from the\\nmountain‚Äîwhich was very good for the landscape and turned \\nout to be\\neven better public relations. In January 1996, Fischer led a high-profile\\nfund-raising ascent of Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa, that\\nnetted half a million dollars for the charity CARE. Thanks largely to the\\n1994 Everest cleanup expedition and this latter charity climb, by the\\ntime Fischer left for Everest in 1996 he had been featured prominently\\nand often in the Seattle news media, and his climbing career was\\nsoaring.\\nJournalists inevitably asked Fischer about the risks associated with the\\nkind of climbing he did and wondered how he reconciled it with being a\\nhusband and father. Fischer answered that he now took far fewer\\nchances than he had during his reckless youth‚Äîthat he had become a\\nmuch more careful, more conservative climber. Shortly before leaving\\nfor Everest in 1996, he told Seattle writer Bruce Barcott, ‚ÄúI believe 100\\npercent I‚Äôm coming back.‚Ä¶ My wife believes 100 percent I‚Äôm coming\\nback. She isn‚Äôt concerned about me at all when I‚Äôm guiding because I‚Äôm\\ngonna make all the right choices. When accidents happen, I think it‚Äôs\\nalways human error. So that‚Äôs what I want to eliminate. I‚Äôve had lots of\\nclimbing accidents in my youth. You come up with lots of reasons, but\\nultimately it‚Äôs human error.‚Äù\\nFischer‚Äôs assurances notwithstanding, his peripatetic alpine career was\\nrough on his family. He was crazy about his kids, and when he was in\\nSeattle he was an unusually attentive father, but climbing regularly took\\nhim away from home for months at a time. \\nHe‚Äôd been absent for seven ofhis son‚Äôs nine birthdays. In fact, say some of his friends, by the time he\\ndeparted for Everest in 1996, Fischer‚Äôs marriage had been badly\\nstrained.\\nBut Jean Price doesn‚Äôt attribute the rough patch in their relationship\\nto Scott‚Äôs climbing. She says, rather, that any stress in the Fischer‚ÄìPrice\\nhousehold owed more to problems she was having with her employer:\\nthe victim of alleged sexual harassment, throughout 1995 Price was\\nembroiled in a disheartening legal claim against Alaska Airlines.\\nAlthough the suit was eventually resolved, the legal wrangling had been\\nnasty, and had deprived her of a paycheck for the better part of a year.\\nRevenues from Fischer‚Äôs guiding business weren‚Äôt nearly enough to make\\nup for the loss of Price‚Äôs substantial flying income. ‚ÄúFor the first time\\nsince moving to Seattle, we had money problems,‚Äù she laments.'\n",

A\\nlittle later, around 8:30 A.M., I arrived at the top of the Icefall itself, just\\nbeyond the last of the seracs. The safety of Camp One didn‚Äôt supply\\nmuch peace of mind, however: I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about the\\nominously tilted slab a short distance below, and the fact that I would\\nhave to pass beneath its faltering bulk at least seven more times if I was\\ngoing to make it to the summit of Everest. Climbers who snidely\\ndenigrate this as the Yak Route, I decided, had obviously never been\\nthrough the Khumbu Icefall.\\nBefore leaving the tents Rob had explained that we would turn around\\nat 10:00 A.M. sharp, even if some of us hadn‚Äôt reached Camp One, in\\norder to return to Base Camp before the midday sun made the Icefall\\neven more unstable. At the appointed hour only Rob, Frank Fischbeck,\\nJohn Taske, Doug Hansen, and I had arrived at Camp One; Yasuko\\nNamba, Stuart Hutchison, Beck Weathers, and Lou Kasischke, escorted\\nby guides Mike Groom and Andy Harris, were within 200 vertical feet of\\nthe camp when Rob got on the radio and turned everybody around.\\nFor the first time we had seen one another actually climbing and could\\nbetter assess the strengths and weaknesses of the people on whom we\\nwould each depend over the coming weeks. Doug and John‚Äîat fifty-six,\\nthe oldest person on the team‚Äîhad both \\nlooked solid. But Frank, the\\ngentlemanly, soft-spoken publisher from Hong Kong, was the mostimpressive: demonstrating the savvy he‚Äôd acquired over three previous\\nEverest expeditions, he‚Äôd started out slowly but kept moving at the same\\nsteady pace; by the top of the Icefall he‚Äôd quietly passed almost\\neveryone, and he never even seemed to be breathing hard.\\nIn marked contrast, Stuart‚Äîthe youngest and seemingly strongest\\nclient on the whole team‚Äîhad dashed out of camp at the front of the\\ngroup, soon exhausted himself, and by the top of the Icefall was in\\nvisible agony at the back of the line. Lou, hampered by a leg muscle he‚Äôd\\ninjured on the first morning of the trek to Base Camp, was slow but\\ncompetent. Beck, and especially Yasuko, on the other hand, had looked\\nsketchy.\\nSeveral times both Beck and Yasuko had appeared to be in danger of\\nfalling off a ladder and plummeting into a crevasse, and Yasuko seemed\\nto know next to nothing about how to use crampons.\\n*\\n Andy, who\\nrevealed himself to be a gifted, extremely patient teacher‚Äîand who, as\\nthe junior guide, had been assigned to climb with the slowest clients, at\\nthe \\nrear‚Äîspent the whole morning coaching her on basic ice-climbing\\ntechniques.\\nWhatever our group‚Äôs various shortcomings, at the top of the Icefall,\\nRob announced that he was quite pleased with everyone‚Äôs performance.\\n‚ÄúFor your first time above Base Camp you‚Äôve all done remarkably well,‚Äù\\nhe proclaimed like a proud father. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve got a good strong\\nbunch this year.‚Äù\\nIt took little more than an hour to descend back to Base Camp. By the\\ntime I removed my crampons to walk the last hundred yards to the tents,\\nthe sun felt like it was boring a hole through the crown of my skull. The\\nfull force of the headache struck a few minutes later, as I was chatting\\nwith Helen and Chhongba in the mess tent. I‚Äôd never experienced\\nanything like it: crushing pain between my temples‚Äîpain so severe that\\nit was accompanied by shuddering waves of nausea and made it\\nimpossible for me to speak in coherent sentences. Fearing that I‚Äôd\\nsuffered some sort of stroke, I staggered away in mid-conversation,\\nretreated to my sleeping bag, and pulled my hat over my eyes.\\nThe headache had the blinding intensity of a migraine, and I had no\\nidea what had caused it. I doubted that it was due to the altitude,because it didn‚Äôt strike until I‚Äôd returned to Base Camp. More likely it\\nwas a reaction to the fierce ultraviolet radiation that had burned my\\nretinas and baked my brain. Whatever had brought it on, the agony was\\nintense and unrelenting. For the next five hours I lay in my \\ntent trying to\\navoid sensory stimuli of any kind. If I opened my eyes, or even just\\nmoved them from side to side behind closed eyelids, I received a\\nwithering jolt of pain. At sunset, unable to bear it any longer, I stumbled\\nover to the medical tent to seek advice from Caroline, the expedition\\ndoctor.\\nShe gave me a strong analgesic and told me to drink some water, but\\nafter a few swallows I regurgitated the pills, the liquid, and the remnants\\nof lunch. ‚ÄúHmmm,‚Äù mused Caro, observing the vomitus splashed across\\nmy boots. ‚ÄúI guess we‚Äôll have to try something else.‚Äù I was instructed to\\ndissolve a tiny pill under my tongue, which would keep me from\\nvomiting, and then swallow two codeine pills. An hour later the pain\\nbegan to fade; nearly weeping with gratitude I drifted into\\nunconsciousness.\\nI was dozing in my sleeping bag, watching the morning sun cast\\nshadows across the walls of my tent, when Helen yelled, ‚ÄúJon!\\nTelephone! It‚Äôs Linda!‚Äù I yanked on a pair of sandals, sprinted the fifty\\nyards to the communications tent, and grabbed the handset as I fought\\nto catch my breath.\\nThe entire satellite phone-and-fax apparatus wasn‚Äôt much larger than a\\nlaptop computer. Calls were expensive‚Äîabout five dollars a minute‚Äî\\nand they didn‚Äôt always go through, but the fact that my wife could dial a\\nthirteen-digit number in Seattle and speak to me on Mount Everest\\nastounded me. \\nAlthough the call was a great comfort, the resignation in\\nLinda‚Äôs voice was unmistakable even from the far side of the globe. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm\\ndoing fine,‚Äù she assured me, ‚Äúbut I wish you were here.‚Äù\\nEighteen days earlier she‚Äôd broken into tears when she‚Äôd taken me to\\nthe plane to Nepal. ‚ÄúDriving home from the airport,‚Äù she confessed, ‚ÄúI\\ncouldn‚Äôt stop crying. Saying good-bye to you was one of the saddest\\nthings I‚Äôve ever done. I guess I knew on some level that you might not be\\ncoming back, and it seemed like such a waste. It seemed so fuckingstupid and pointless.‚Äù\\nWe‚Äôd been married for fifteen and a half years. Within a week of first\\ntalking about taking the plunge, we‚Äôd visited a justice of the peace and\\ndone the deed. I was twenty-six at the time and had recently decided to\\nquit climbing and get serious about life.\\nWhen I first met Linda she had been a climber herself‚Äîand an\\nexceptionally gifted one‚Äîbut she‚Äôd given it up after breaking an arm,\\ninjuring her back, and subsequently making a cold appraisal of the\\ninherent risks. Linda would never have considered asking me to abandon\\nthe sport, but the announcement that I intended to quit had reinforced\\nher decision to marry me. I‚Äôd failed to appreciate the grip climbing had\\non my soul, however, or the purpose it lent to my otherwise rudderless\\nlife. I didn‚Äôt anticipate the void that would loom in its absence. Within a\\nyear I sneaked my rope out of storage and was back on the rock. By\\n1984, when I went to Switzerland to \\nclimb a notoriously dangerous\\nalpine wall called the Eiger Nordwand, Linda and I had advanced to\\nwithin millimeters of splitting up, and my climbing lay at the core of our\\ntroubles.\\nOur relationship remained rocky for two or three years after my failed\\nattempt on the Eiger, but the marriage somehow survived that rough\\npatch. Linda came to accept my climbing: she saw that it was a crucial\\n(if perplexing) part of who I was. Mountaineering, she understood, was\\nan essential expression of some odd, immutable aspect of my personality\\nthat I could no sooner alter than change the color of my eyes. Then, in\\nthe midst of this delicate rapprochement, \\nOutside\\n magazine confirmed it\\nwas sending me to Everest.\\nAt first I pretended that I‚Äôd be going as a journalist more than a\\nclimber‚Äîthat I‚Äôd accepted the assignment because the\\ncommercialization of Everest was an interesting subject and the money\\nwas pretty good. I explained to Linda and anyone else who expressed\\nskepticism about my Himalayan qualifications that I didn‚Äôt expect to\\nascend very high on the mountain. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll probably climb only a little way\\nabove Base Camp,‚Äù I insisted. ‚ÄúJust to get a taste of what high altitude is\\nabout.‚Äù\\nThis was bullshit, of course. Given the length of the trip and the timeI‚Äôd have to spend training for it, I stood to make a lot more money\\nstaying home and taking other writing jobs. I accepted the assignment\\nbecause I was in the grip of the Everest mystique. In \\ntruth, I wanted to\\nclimb the mountain as badly as I‚Äôd ever wanted anything in my life.\\nFrom the moment I agreed to go to Nepal my intention was to ascend\\nevery bit as high as my unexceptional legs and lungs would carry me.\\nBy the time Linda drove me to the airport she had long since seen\\nthrough my prevarications. She sensed the true dimensions of my desire,\\nand it scared her. ‚ÄúIf you get killed,‚Äù she argued with a mix of despair\\nand anger, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not just you who‚Äôll pay the price. I‚Äôll have to pay, too,\\nyou know, for the rest of my life. Doesn‚Äôt that matter to you?‚Äù\\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to get killed,‚Äù I answered. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be melodramatic.‚Äù\\n*\\n Ever since the first Everest attempts, most expeditions‚Äîcommercial and noncommercial alike\\n‚Äîhave relied on Sherpas to carry the majority of the loads on the mountain. But as clients on a\\nguided trip, we carried no loads at all beyond a small amount of personal gear, and in this\\nregard we differed significantly from noncommercial expeditions of yore.\\n*\\n A \\nbergschrund\\n is a deep slit that delineates a glacier‚Äôs upper terminus; it forms as the body of ice\\nslides away from the steeper wall immediately above, leaving a gap between glacier and rock.\\n*\\n Although I use ‚Äúcommercial‚Äù to denote any expedition organized as a money-making venture,\\nnot all commercial expeditions are guided. For instance, Mal Duff‚Äîwho charged his clients\\nconsiderably less than the $65,000 fee requested by Hall and Fischer‚Äîprovided leadership and\\nthe essential infrastructure necessary to climb Everest (food, tents, bottled oxygen, fixed ropes,\\nSherpa support staff, and so on) but did not purport to act as a guide; the climbers on his team'\n",

Ms. O‚ÄôDowd walked to\\nthe team‚Äôs Sherpa leader, Ang Dorje, and said \\naudibly: ‚ÄúThis is Ken Vernon, one of the ones\\nwe told you about. He is to be given no assistance whatsoever.‚Äù Ang Dorje is a tough,\\nnuggety rock of a man and we had already shared several glasses of Chang, the fiery local\\nbrew. I looked at him and said, ‚ÄúNot even a cup of tea?‚Äù To his credit, and in the best\\ntradition of Sherpa hospitality, he looked at Ms. O‚ÄôDowd and said: ‚ÄúBullshit.‚Äù He grabbed me\\nby the arm, dragged me into the mess tent and served up a mug of steaming tea and a plate\\nof biscuits.\\nFollowing what Owen described as his ‚Äúblood-chilling exchange‚Äù with\\nWoodall in Pheriche, the editor was ‚Äúpersuaded ‚Ä¶ that the atmosphere\\nof the expedition was deranged and that the \\nSunday Times\\n staffers, Ken\\nVernon and Richard Shorey, might be in danger of their lives.‚Äù Owen\\ntherefore instructed Vernon and Shorey to return to South Africa, and\\nthe newspaper published a statement declaring that it had rescinded its\\nsponsorship of the expedition.Because Woodall had already received the newspaper‚Äôs money,\\nhowever, this act was purely symbolic and had almost no impact on his\\nactions on the mountain. Indeed, Woodall refused to relinquish\\nleadership of the expedition or make any kind of compromise, even after\\nhe received a message from President Mandela appealing for\\nreconciliation as a matter of national interest. Woodall stubbornly\\ninsisted that the Everest climb would proceed as planned, with him\\nfirmly at the helm.\\nBack in Cape Town after the expedition fell apart, February described\\nhis disappointment. ‚ÄúMaybe I was naive,‚Äù he said in a halting voice\\nfreighted with emotion. ‚ÄúBut I hated growing up under apartheid.\\nClimbing Everest with Andrew and the others would have been a great\\nsymbol to show the old ways had broken down. Woodall had no interest\\nin the birth of a new South Africa. He took the dreams of the entire\\nnation and utilized them for his own selfish purposes. Deciding to leave\\nthe expedition was the hardest decision of my life.‚Äù\\nWith the departure of February, Hackland, and de Klerk, none of the\\nclimbers remaining on the team (aside from the Frenchman Renard, who\\nhad joined the expedition merely to be listed on the permit and who\\nclimbed independently from the others, with his own Sherpas) had little\\nmore than minimal alpine experience; at least two of them, says de\\nKlerk, ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt even know how to put their crampons on.‚Äù\\nThe solo Norwegian, the Taiwanese, and especially the South Africans\\nwere frequent topics of discussion in Hall‚Äôs mess tent. ‚ÄúWith so many\\nincompetent people on the mountain,‚Äù Rob said with a frown one\\nevening in late April, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs pretty unlikely that we‚Äôll get through\\nthis season without something bad happening up high.‚Äù\\n*\\n \\nBelay\\n is a climbing term that denotes the act of securing a rope to safeguard one‚Äôs companions\\nas they climb.\\n*\\n Although Neby‚Äôs expedition was billed as a ‚Äúsolo‚Äù endeavor, he had employed eighteen Sherpas\\nto carry his loads, fix ropes for him, establish his camps, and guide him up the mountain.\\n*\\n Only climbers listed on the official permit‚Äîat a cost of $10,000 a head‚Äîare allowed to ascend\\nabove Base Camp. This rule is strictly enforced, and violators face prohibitive fines and\\nexpulsion from Nepal.J\\nEIGHT\\nCAMP ONE\\nAPRIL 16, 1996 ‚Ä¢ 19,500 FEET\\nI doubt if anyone would claim to enjoy life at high altitudes‚Äîenjoy, that is, in the ordinary sense\\nof the word. There is a certain grim satisfaction to be derived from struggling upwards, however\\nslowly; but the bulk of one‚Äôs time is necessarily spent in the extreme squalor of a high camp, when\\neven this solace is lacking. Smoking is impossible; eating tends to make one vomit; the necessity of\\nreducing weight to a bare minimum forbids the importation of literature beyond that supplied by\\nthe labels on tins of food; sardine oil, condensed milk and treacle spill themselves all over the place;\\nexcept for the briefest moments, during which one is not usually in a mood for aesthetic enjoyment,\\nthere is nothing to look at but the bleak confusion inside the tent and the scaly, bearded\\ncountenance of one‚Äôs companion‚Äîfortunately the noise of the wind usually drowns out his stuffy\\nbreathing; worst of all is the feeling of complete helplessness and inability to deal with any\\nemergency that might arise. I used to try to console myself with the thought that a year ago I would\\nhave been thrilled by the very idea of taking part in our present adventure, a prospect that had then\\nseemed like an impossible dream; but altitude has the same effect on the mind as\\n \\nupon the body,\\none‚Äôs intellect becomes dull and unresponsive, and my only desire was to finish the wretched job\\nand to get down to a more reasonable clime\\n.\\nEric Shipton           \\nUpon That Mountain\\nust before dawn on Tuesday, April 16, after resting for two\\ndays at Base Camp, we headed up into the Icefall to begin\\nour second acclimatization excursion. As I nervously threaded my way\\nthrough the frozen, groaning disorder, I noticed that my breathing\\nwasn‚Äôt quite as labored as it had been during our first trip up the glacier;\\nalready my body was starting to adapt to the altitude. My dread of\\ngetting crushed by a falling serac, however, was at least as great as\\nbefore.\\nI‚Äôd hoped that the giant overhanging tower at 19,000 feet‚Äîchristened\\nthe Mousetrap by some wag on Fischer‚Äôs team‚Äîhad toppled by now, butit was still precariously upright, leaning even farther over. Again I\\nredlined my cardiovascular output rushing to ascend from its threatening\\nshadow, and again dropped to my knees when I arrived on the serac‚Äôs\\nsummit, gasping for air and trembling from the excess of adrenaline\\nfizzing through my veins.\\nUnlike our first acclimatization sally, during which we stayed at Camp\\nOne for less than an hour \\nbefore returning to Base Camp, Rob intended\\nfor us to spend Tuesday and Wednesday nights at Camp One and then\\ncontinue up to Camp Two for three additional nights before heading\\ndown.\\nAt 9:00 A.M., when I reached the Camp One site, Ang Dorje,\\n*\\n our\\nclimbing sirdar,\\n‚Ä†\\n was excavating platforms for our tents in the hard-\\nfrozen snow slope. Twenty-nine years old, he is a slender man with\\ndelicate features, a shy, moody temperament, and astounding physical\\nstrength. While waiting for my teammates to arrive, I picked up a spare\\nshovel and started helping him dig. Within minutes I was exhausted\\nfrom the effort and had to sit down to rest, prompting a belly laugh from\\nthe Sherpa. ‚ÄúAre you not feeling good, Jon?‚Äù he mocked. ‚ÄúThis is only\\nCamp One, six thousand meters. The air here is still very thick.‚Äù\\nAng Dorje hailed from Pangboche, an aggregation of stonewalled\\nhouses and terraced potato fields clinging to a rugged hillside at 13,000\\nfeet. His \\nfather is a respected climbing Sherpa who taught him the basics\\nof mountaineering at an early age so that the boy would have\\nmarketable skills. By the time Ang Dorje was in his teens, his father had\\nlost most of his sight to cataracts, and Ang Dorje was pulled from school\\nto earn money for the family.\\nIn 1984 he was working as a cook boy for a group of Western trekkers\\nwhen he caught the attention of a Canadian couple, Marion Boyd and\\nGraem Nelson. According to Boyd, ‚ÄúI was missing my kids, and as I grew\\nto know Ang Dorje he reminded me of my eldest son. Ang Dorje was\\nbright, interested, keen to learn, and conscientious almost to a fault. He\\nwas carrying a huge load and he had nosebleeds every day at high\\naltitude. I was intrigued.‚Äù\\nAfter seeking the approval of Ang Dorje‚Äôs mother, Boyd and Nelson\\nstarted supporting the young Sherpa financially so that he could returnto school. ‚ÄúI will never forget his entry exam [to gain admission to the\\nregional primary school in Khumjung, built by Sir Edmund Hillary]. He\\nwas very small in stature and prepubescent. We were crammed into a\\nsmall room with the headmaster and four teachers.

It stormed through the night; in the morning\\nwhen I crawled out of the shelter I shared with Doug, more than a foot\\nof fresh snow blanketed the glacier. \\nDozens of avalanches rumbled down\\nthe steep walls above, but our camp was safely beyond their reach.\\nAt first light on Thursday, April 18, by which time the sky had\\ncleared, we gathered our belongings and embarked for Camp Two, four\\nmiles and 1,700 vertical feet above. The route took us up the gently\\nsloping floor of the Western Cwm, the highest box canyon on earth, ahorseshoe-shaped defile gouged from the heart of the Everest massif by\\nthe Khumbu Glacier. The 25,790-foot ramparts of Nuptse defined the\\nright wall of the Cwm, Everest‚Äôs massive Southwest Face formed the left\\nwall, and the broad frozen thrust of the Lhotse Face loomed above its\\nhead.\\nThe temperature had been brutally cold when we set out from Camp\\nOne, turning my hands into stiff, aching claws, but as the first of the\\nsun‚Äôs rays struck the glacier, the ice-spackled walls of the Cwm collected\\nand amplified the radiant heat like a huge solar oven. Suddenly I was\\nsweltering, and I feared the onset of another migraine-intensity\\nheadache like the one that had hammered me at Base Camp, so I\\nstripped down to my long underwear and stuffed a fistful of snow\\nbeneath my baseball cap. For the next three hours I slogged steadily up\\nthe glacier, pausing only to drink from my water bottle and replenish the\\nsnow supply in my hat as it melted into my matted hair.\\nAt 21,000 feet, dizzy from the heat, I came upon a large object\\nwrapped in blue plastic sheeting beside the trail. It took my altitude-\\nimpaired gray matter a \\nminute or two to comprehend that the object was\\na human body. Shocked and disturbed, I stared at it for several minutes.\\nThat night when I asked Rob about it he said he wasn‚Äôt certain, but he\\nthought the victim was a Sherpa who‚Äôd died three years earlier.\\nAt 21,300 feet, Camp Two consisted of some 120 tents scattered across\\nthe bare rocks of the lateral moraine along the glacier‚Äôs edge. The\\naltitude here manifested itself as a malicious force, making me feel as\\nthough I were afflicted with a raging red-wine hangover. Too miserable\\nto eat or even read, for the next two days I mostly lay in my tent with\\nmy head in my hands, trying to exert myself as little as possible. Feeling\\nslightly better on Saturday, I climbed a thousand feet above camp to get\\nsome exercise and accelerate my acclimatization, and there, at the head\\nof the Cwm, fifty yards off the main track, I came upon another body in\\nthe snow, or more accurately the lower half of a body. The style of the\\nclothing and the vintage leather boots suggested that the victim was\\nEuropean and that the corpse had lain on the mountain at least ten or\\nfifteen years.\\nThe first body had left me badly shaken for several hours; the shock of\\nencountering the second wore off almost immediately. Few of theclimbers trudging by had given either corpse more than a passing glance.\\nIt was as if there were an unspoken agreement on the mountain to\\npretend that these desiccated remains weren‚Äôt real‚Äîas if none of us\\ndared to acknowledge what was at stake here.\\nOn Monday, April 22, a day after returning from Camp Two to Base\\nCamp, Andy Harris and I hiked over to the South African compound to\\nmeet their team and try to gain some insight into why they had become\\nsuch pariahs. Fifteen minutes down the glacier from our tents, their\\ncamp was clustered atop a hump of glacial debris. The national flags of\\nNepal and South Africa, along with banners from Kodak, Apple\\nComputer, and other sponsors, flew from a pair of tall aluminum\\nflagpoles. Andy stuck his head inside the door of their mess tent, flashed\\nhis most winning smile, and inquired, ‚ÄúHi there. Is anybody home?‚Äù\\nIt turned out that Ian Woodall, Cathy O‚ÄôDowd, and Bruce Herrod were\\nin the Icefall, making their way down from Camp Two, but Woodall‚Äôs\\ngirlfriend, Alexandrine Gaudin, was present, as was his brother, Philip.\\nAlso in the mess tent was an effervescent young woman who introduced\\nherself as Deshun Deysel and immediately invited Andy and me in for\\ntea. The three teammates seemed unconcerned by the reports of Ian‚Äôs\\nreprehensible behavior and rumors predicting their expedition‚Äôs\\nimminent disintegration.\\n‚ÄúI went ice climbing for the first time the other day,‚Äù Deysel offered\\nenthusiastically, gesturing toward a nearby serac where climbers from\\nseveral expeditions had been practicing their ice craft. ‚ÄúI thought it was\\nquite exciting. I hope to go up the \\nIcefall in a few days.‚Äù I‚Äôd intended to\\nask her about Ian‚Äôs dishonesty and how she felt when she learned she‚Äôd\\nbeen left off the Everest permit, but she was so cheerful and ingenuous\\nthat I didn‚Äôt have the stomach for it. After chatting for twenty minutes\\nAndy extended an invitation to their whole team, including Ian, ‚Äúto\\ncome ‚Äôround our camp for a wee snort‚Äù later that evening.\\nI arrived back at our own camp to find Rob, Dr. Caroline Mackenzie,\\nand Scott Fischer‚Äôs doctor, Ingrid Hunt, engaged in a tense radio\\nconversation with someone higher on the mountain. Earlier in the day,\\nFischer was descending from Camp Two to Base Camp when heencountered one of his Sherpas, Ngawang Topche, sitting on the glacier\\nat 21,000 feet. A veteran thirty-eight-year-old climber from the\\nRolwaling Valley, gap-toothed and sweet-natured, Ngawang had been\\nhauling loads and performing other duties above Base Camp for three\\ndays, but his Sherpa cohorts complained that he had been sitting around\\na lot and not doing his share of the work.\\nWhen Fischer questioned Ngawang, he admitted that he‚Äôd been feeling\\nweak, groggy, and short of breath for more than two days, so Fischer\\ndirected him to descend to Base Camp immediately. But there is an\\nelement of machismo in the Sherpa culture that makes many men\\nextremely reluctant to acknowledge physical infirmities.

Responsibility for initiating\\nNgawang‚Äôs rescue thus fell to Kev Schoening \\nand Madsen‚Äîthe latter a\\nthirty-three-year-old ski patrolman from Aspen, Colorado, who‚Äôd never\\nbeen higher than 14,000 feet before this expedition, which he had been\\npersuaded to join by his girlfriend, Himalayan veteran Charlotte Fox.\\nWhen I walked into Hall‚Äôs mess tent, Dr. Mackenzie was on the radiotelling somebody at Camp Two, ‚Äúgive Ngawang acetazolamide,\\ndexamethasone, and ten milligrams of sublingual nifedipine.‚Ä¶ Yes, I\\nknow the risk. Give it to him anyway.‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm telling you, the danger that\\nhe will die from HAPE before we can get him down is much, much\\ngreater than the danger that the nifedipine will reduce his blood\\npressure to a dangerous level. Please, trust me on this! Just give him the\\nmedication! Quickly!‚Äù\\nNone of the drugs seemed to help, however, nor did giving Ngawang\\nsupplemental oxygen or placing him inside a Gamow Bag‚Äîan inflatable\\nplastic chamber about the size of a coffin in which the atmospheric\\npressure is increased to simulate a lower altitude. With daylight waning,\\nSchoening and Madsen therefore began dragging Ngawang laboriously\\ndown the mountain, using the deflated Gamow Bag as a makeshift\\ntoboggan, while guide Neal Beidleman and a team of Sherpas climbed as\\nquickly as they could from Base Camp to meet them.\\nBeidleman reached Ngawang at sunset near the top of the Icefall and\\ntook over the rescue, allowing Schoening and Madsen to return to Camp\\nTwo to continue \\ntheir acclimatization. The sick Sherpa had so much\\nfluid in his lungs, Beidleman recalled, ‚Äúthat when he breathed it sounded\\nlike a straw slurping a milkshake from the bottom of a glass. Halfway\\ndown the Icefall, Ngawang took off his oxygen mask and reached inside\\nto clear some snot from the intake valve. When he pulled his hand out I\\nshined my headlamp on his glove and it was totally red, soaked with\\nblood he‚Äôd been coughing up into the mask. Then I shined the light on\\nhis face and it was covered with blood, too.\\n‚ÄúNgawang‚Äôs eyes met mine and I could see how frightened he was,‚Äù\\nBeidleman continued. ‚ÄúThinking fast, I lied and told him not to worry,\\nthat the blood was from a cut on his lip. That calmed him a little, and\\nwe continued down.‚Äù To keep Ngawang from having to exert himself,\\nwhich would have exacerbated his edema, at several points during the\\ndescent, Beidleman picked up the ailing Sherpa and carried him on his\\nback. It was after midnight by the time they arrived in Base Camp.\\nKept on oxygen and watched closely throughout the night by Dr.\\nHunt, by morning Ngawang was doing slightly better. Fischer, Hunt, and\\nmost of the other doctors involved were confident that the Sherpa‚Äôs\\ncondition would continue to improve now that he was 3,700 feet lowerthan Camp Two; descending as little as 2,000 feet is typically enough to\\nbring about complete recovery from HAPE. For this reason, Hunt\\nexplains, ‚Äúthere was no discussion \\nof a helicopter‚Äù to evacuate Ngawang\\nfrom Base Camp to Kathmandu, which would have cost $5,000.\\n‚ÄúUnfortunately,‚Äù says Hunt, Ngawang ‚Äúdid not continue to improve.\\nBy late morning he started to deteriorate again.‚Äù At this point Hunt\\nconcluded that he needed to be evacuated, but by now the sky had\\nturned cloudy, ruling out the possibility of a helicopter flight. She\\nproposed to Ngima Kale Sherpa, Fischer‚Äôs Base Camp sirdar, that they\\nassemble a team of Sherpas to take Ngawang down the valley on foot.\\nNgima balked at this idea, however. According to Hunt, the sirdar was\\nadamant that Ngawang didn‚Äôt have HAPE or any other form of altitude\\nillness, ‚Äúbut rather was suffering from ‚Äògastric,‚Äô the Nepali term for\\nstomachache,‚Äù and that an evacuation was unnecessary.\\nHunt persuaded Ngima to allow two Sherpas to help her escort\\nNgawang to a lower elevation. The stricken man walked so slowly and\\nwith such difficulty, though, that after covering less than a quarter-mile\\nit became obvious to Hunt that he couldn‚Äôt travel under his own power,\\nand that she would need a lot more help. So she turned around and\\nbrought Ngawang back to the Mountain Madness encampment, she says,\\n‚Äúto reconsider my options.‚Äù\\nNgawang‚Äôs condition continued to worsen as the day dragged on.\\nWhen Hunt attempted to put him back in the Gamow Bag, Ngawang\\nrefused, arguing, \\nas Ngima had, that he didn‚Äôt have HAPE. Hunt\\nconsulted with the other doctors at Base Camp (as she had throughout\\nthe expedition), but she didn‚Äôt have an opportunity to discuss the\\nsituation with Fischer: By this time Scott had embarked for Camp Two to\\nbring down Tim Madsen, who had overexerted himself while hauling\\nNgawang down the Western Cwm and had subsequently come down\\nwith HAPE himself. With Fischer absent, the Sherpas were disinclined to\\ndo what Hunt asked of them. The situation was growing more critical by\\nthe hour. As one of her fellow physicians observed, ‚ÄúIngrid was in way\\nover her head.‚Äù\\nThirty-two years old, Hunt had completed her residency only the\\nprevious July. Although she had no prior experience in the specialized\\nfield of high-altitude medicine, she had spent four months doingvolunteer medical-relief work in the foothills of eastern Nepal. She‚Äôd met\\nFischer by chance some months earlier in Kathmandu when he was\\nfinalizing his Everest permit, and he subsequently invited her to\\naccompany his upcoming Everest expedition in the dual roles of team\\nphysician and Base Camp manager.\\nAlthough she expressed some ambivalence about the invitation in a\\nletter Fischer received in January, ultimately Hunt accepted the unpaid\\njob and met the team in Nepal at the end of March, eager to contribute\\nto the expedition‚Äôs success. But the demands of simultaneously running\\nBase Camp and meeting \\nthe medical needs of some twenty-five people in\\na remote, high-altitude environment proved to be more than she‚Äôd\\nbargained for. (By comparison, Rob Hall paid two highly experienced\\nstaff members‚Äîteam physician Caroline Mackenzie and Base Camp\\nmanager Helen Wilton‚Äîto do what Hunt did alone, without pay.)\\nCompounding her difficulties, moreover, Hunt had trouble acclimatizing\\nand suffered severe headaches and shortness of breath during most of\\nher stay at Base Camp.\\nTuesday evening, after the evacuation was aborted and Ngawang\\nreturned to Base Camp, the Sherpa grew increasingly sick, partly because\\nboth he and Ngima stubbornly confounded Hunt‚Äôs efforts to treat him,\\ncontinuing to insist that he didn‚Äôt have HAPE. Earlier in the day, Dr.\\nMackenzie had sent an urgent radio message to the American doctor Jim\\nLitch, requesting that he hurry to Base Camp to assist in Ngawang‚Äôs\\ntreatment. Dr. Litch‚Äîa respected expert in high-altitude medicine who\\nhad summitted Everest in 1995‚Äîarrived at 7:00 P.M. after running up\\nfrom Pheriche, where he was serving as a volunteer at the Himalayan\\nRescue Association clinic. He found Ngawang lying in a tent, attended\\nby a Sherpa who had allowed Ngawang to remove his oxygen mask.\\nProfoundly alarmed by Ngawang‚Äôs condition, Litch was shocked that he\\nwasn‚Äôt on oxygen and didn‚Äôt understand why he hadn‚Äôt been evacuated'\n",

This forms the\\nnub of a dilemma that every Everest climber eventually comes up\\nagainst: in order to succeed you must be exceedingly driven, but if\\nyou‚Äôre too driven you‚Äôre likely to die. Above 26,000 feet, moreover, the\\nline between appropriate zeal and reckless summit fever becomes\\ngrievously thin. Thus the slopes of Everest are littered with corpses.\\nTaske, Hutchison, Kasischke, and Fischbeck had each spent as much as\\n$70,000 and endured weeks of agony to be granted this one shot at thesummit. All were ambitious men, unaccustomed to losing and even less\\nto quitting. And yet, faced with a tough \\ndecision, they were among the\\nfew who made the right choice that day.\\nAbove the rock step where John, Stuart, and Lou turned around, the\\nfixed ropes ended. From this point the route angled steeply upward\\nalong a graceful ar√™te of wind-compacted snow that culminated in the\\nSouth Summit‚Äîwhere I arrived at 11:00 to find a second, even worse\\nbottleneck. A little higher, seemingly no more than a stone‚Äôs throw\\naway, was the vertical gash of the Hillary Step, and slightly beyond that\\nthe summit itself. Rendered dumb with awe and fatigue, I took some\\nphotos, then sat down with guides Andy Harris, Neal Beidleman, and\\nAnatoli Boukreev to wait for the Sherpas to fix ropes along the\\nspectacularly corniced summit ridge.\\nI noticed that Boukreev, like Lopsang, wasn‚Äôt using supplemental\\noxygen. Although the Russian had summitted Everest twice before\\nwithout gas, and Lopsang thrice, I was surprised Fischer had given them\\npermission to guide the peak without it, which didn‚Äôt seem to be in their\\nclients‚Äô best interest. I was also surprised to see that Boukreev didn‚Äôt\\nhave a backpack‚Äîcustomarily a guide would carry a pack containing\\nrope, first-aid supplies, crevasse-rescue gear, extra clothing, and other\\nitems necessary to assist clients in the event of an emergency. Boukreev\\nwas the first guide I‚Äôd ever seen, on any mountain, ignore this\\nconvention.\\nIt turned out that he had departed Camp Four carrying both a\\nbackpack and an oxygen bottle; he \\nlater told me that although he didn‚Äôt\\nintend to use the gas, he wanted to have a bottle handy in the event that\\n‚Äúhis power was low‚Äù and he needed it higher on the peak. Upon\\nreaching the Balcony, however, he jettisoned the pack and gave his\\noxygen canister, mask, and regulator to Beidleman to carry for him.\\nBecause Boukreev wasn‚Äôt breathing supplemental oxygen, he had\\napparently decided to strip his load down to the bare minimum to gain\\nevery possible advantage in the appallingly thin air.\\nA 20-knot breeze raked the ridge, blowing a plume of spindrift far\\nover the Kangshung Face, but overhead the sky was an achingly brilliant\\nblue. Lounging in the sun at 28,700 feet inside my thick down suit,\\ngazing across the roof of the world in a hypoxic stupor, I completely losttrack of time. None of us paid much attention to the fact that Ang Dorje\\nand Ngawang Norbu, another Sherpa on Hall‚Äôs team, were sitting beside\\nus sharing a thermos of tea and seemed to be in no hurry to go higher.\\nAround 11:40, Beidleman eventually asked, ‚ÄúHey, Ang Dorje, are you\\ngoing to fix the ropes, or what?‚Äù Ang Dorje‚Äôs reply was a quick,\\nunequivocal ‚ÄúNo‚Äù‚Äîperhaps because none of Fischer‚Äôs Sherpas were\\nthere to share the work.\\nGrowing alarmed at the crowd stacking up at the South Summit,\\nBeidleman roused Harris and Boukreev and strongly suggested that the\\nthree guides install the ropes themselves; hearing this, I quickly\\nvolunteered to help. Beidleman pulled a 150-foot coil of rope from his\\npack, I grabbed another \\ncoil from Ang Dorje, and with Boukreev and\\nHarris we got under way at noon to fix lines up the summit ridge. But by\\nthen another hour had already trickled away.\\nBottled oxygen does not make the top of Everest feel like sea level.\\nClimbing above the South Summit with my regulator delivering just\\nunder two liters of oxygen per minute, I had to stop and draw three or\\nfour lungfuls of air after each ponderous step. Then I‚Äôd take one more\\nstep and have to pause for another four heaving breaths‚Äîand this was\\nthe fastest pace I could manage. Because the oxygen systems we were\\nusing delivered a lean mix of compressed gas and ambient air, 29,000\\nfeet with gas felt like approximately 26,000 feet without gas. But the\\nbottled oxygen conferred other benefits that weren‚Äôt so easily quantified.\\nClimbing along the blade of the summit ridge, sucking gas into my\\nragged lungs, I enjoyed a strange, unwarranted sense of calm. The world\\nbeyond the rubber mask was stupendously vivid but seemed not quite\\nreal, as if a movie were being projected in slow motion across the front\\nof my goggles. I felt drugged, disengaged, thoroughly insulated from\\nexternal stimuli. I had to remind myself over and over that there was\\n7,000 feet of sky on either side, that everything was at stake here, that I\\nwould pay for a single bungled step with my life.\\nHalf an hour above the South Summit I arrived at the foot of the\\nHillary Step. One of the most famous pitches in all of mountaineering, its\\nforty feet of near-vertical rock and ice looked daunting, but‚Äîas anyserious climber would‚ÄîI‚Äôd wanted very badly to take the ‚Äúsharp end‚Äù of\\nthe rope and lead the Step. It was clear, however, that Boukreev,\\nBeidleman, and Harris all felt the same way, and it was hypoxic delusion\\non my part to think that any of them was going to let a client hog such a\\ncoveted lead.\\nIn the end, Boukreev‚Äîas senior guide and the only one of us who had\\nclimbed Everest previously‚Äîclaimed the honor; with Beidleman paying\\nout the rope, he did a masterful job of leading the pitch. But it was a\\nslow process, and as he painstakingly ascended toward the crest of the\\nStep, I nervously studied my watch and wondered whether I might run\\nout of oxygen. My first canister had expired at 7:00 A.M. on the Balcony,\\nafter lasting about seven hours. Using this as a benchmark, at the South\\nSummit I‚Äôd calculated that my second canister would expire around 2:00\\nP.M., which I‚Äôd stupidly assumed would allow plenty of time to reach\\nthe summit and return to the South Summit to retrieve my third oxygen\\nbottle. But now it was already after 1:00, and I was beginning to have\\nserious doubts.\\nAt the top of the Step I shared my concern with Beidleman and asked\\nwhether he minded if I hurried ahead to the summit instead of pausing\\nto help him string the last coil of rope along the ridge. ‚ÄúGo \\nfor it,‚Äù he\\ngraciously offered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take care of the rope.‚Äù\\nPlodding slowly up the last few steps to the summit, I had the\\nsensation of being underwater, of life moving at quarter speed. And then\\nI found myself atop a slender wedge of ice, adorned with a discarded\\noxygen cylinder and a battered aluminum survey pole, with nowhere\\nhigher to climb. A string of Buddhist prayer flags snapped furiously in\\nthe wind. Far below, down a side of the mountain I had never laid eyes\\non, the dry Tibetan plateau stretched to the horizon as a boundless\\nexpanse of dun-colored earth.\\nReaching the top of Everest is supposed to trigger a surge of intense\\nelation; against long odds, after all, I had just attained a goal I‚Äôd coveted\\nsince childhood. But the summit was really only the halfway point. Any\\nimpulse I might have felt toward self-congratulation was extinguished by\\noverwhelming apprehension about the long, dangerous descent that lay\\nahead.I\\nFOURTEEN\\nSUMMIT\\n1:12 P.M., MAY 10, 1996 ‚Ä¢ 29,028 FEET\\nNot only during the ascent but also during the descent my willpower is dulled.

Then\\nI turned to descend. \\nAbout twenty yards below the summit I passed Neal\\nBeidleman and a client of Fischer‚Äôs named Martin Adams on their way\\nup. After exchanging a high five with Neal, I grabbed a handful of small\\nstones from a wind-scoured patch of exposed shale, zipped the souvenirs\\ninto the pocket of my down suit, and hastened down the ridge.\\nA moment earlier I‚Äôd noticed that wispy clouds now filled the valleys\\nto the south, obscuring all but the highest peaks.

Everyone‚Äôs oxygen had long since\\nrun out, making the group more vulnerable to the windchill, which\\nexceeded a hundred below zero. In the lee of a boulder no larger than a\\ndishwasher, the climbers hunkered in a pathetic row on a patch of gale-\\nscoured ice. ‚ÄúBy then the cold had about finished me off,‚Äù says Charlotte\\nFox. ‚ÄúMy eyes were frozen. I didn‚Äôt see how we were going to get out of\\nit alive. The cold was so painful, I didn‚Äôt think I could endure it\\nanymore. I just curled up in a ball and hoped death would come\\nquickly.‚Äù\\n‚ÄúWe tried to keep warm by pummeling each other,‚Äù Weathers\\nremembers. ‚ÄúSomeone yelled at us to keep moving our arms and legs.\\nSandy was hysterical; she kept yelling over and over, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to\\ndie! I don‚Äôt want to die!‚Äô But nobody else was saying a whole lot.‚ÄùThree hundred yards to the west I was shivering uncontrollably in my\\ntent‚Äîeven though I was zipped into my sleeping bag, and wearing my\\ndown suit and every other stitch of clothing I had. The gale threatened\\nto blow the tent apart. Every time the door was opened, the shelter\\nwould fill with blowing spindrift, so everything inside was covered with\\nan inch-thick layer of snow. Oblivious to the tragedy unfolding outside\\nin the storm, I drifted in \\nand out of consciousness, delirious from\\nexhaustion, dehydration, and the cumulative effects of oxygen depletion.\\nAt some point early in the evening, Stuart Hutchison, my tent-mate,\\ncame in, shook me hard, and asked if I would go outside with him to\\nbang on pots and shine lights into the sky in the hope of guiding the lost\\nclimbers in, but I was too weak and incoherent to respond. Hutchison‚Äî\\nwho had gotten back to camp at 2:00 P.M. and was thus considerably\\nless debilitated than me‚Äîthen tried to rouse clients and Sherpas from\\nthe other tents. Everybody was too cold or too exhausted. So Hutchison\\nwent out into the storm alone.\\nHe left our tent six times that night to look for the missing climbers,\\nbut the blizzard was so fierce that he never dared to venture more than a\\nfew yards beyond the margin of camp. ‚ÄúThe winds were ballistically\\nstrong,‚Äù he emphasizes, ‚ÄúThe blowing spindrift felt like a sandblaster or\\nsomething. I could only go out for fifteen minutes at a time before I\\nbecame too cold and had to return to the tent.‚Äù\\nOut among the climbers hunkered on the eastern edge of the Col,\\nBeidelman willed himself to stay alert for a sign that the storm might be\\nblowing itself out. Just before midnight, his vigilance was rewarded\\nwhen he suddenly noticed a few stars overhead and shouted to the\\nothers to look. The \\nwind was still whipping up a furious ground-blizzard\\nat the surface, but far above, the sky had begun to clear, revealing the\\nhulking silhouettes of Everest and Lhotse. From these reference points,\\nKlev Schoening thought he‚Äôd figured out where the group was in relation\\nto Camp Four. After a shouting match with Beidleman, he convinced the\\nguide that he knew the way to the tents.\\nBeidleman tried to coax everyone to their feet and get them moving in\\nthe direction indicated by Schoening, but Pittman, Fox, Weathers, andNamba were too feeble to walk. By then it was obvious to the guide that\\nif somebody from the group didn‚Äôt make it to the tents and summon a\\nrescue party, they were all going to die. So Beidleman assembled those\\nwho were ambulatory, and then he, Schoening, Gammelgaard, Groom,\\nand the two Sherpas stumbled off into the storm to get help, leaving\\nbehind the four incapacitated clients with Tim Madsen. Reluctant to\\nabandon his girlfriend, Fox, Madsen selflessly volunteered to stay and\\nlook after everybody until help arrived.\\nTwenty minutes later, Beidleman‚Äôs contingent limped into camp,\\nwhere they had an emotional reunion with a very worried Anatoli\\nBoukreev. Schoening and Beidleman, barely able to speak, told the\\nRussian where to find the five clients who‚Äôd remained behind out in the\\nelements and then collapsed in their respective tents, utterly spent.\\nBoukreev had come down to the South Col hours \\nin front of anyone\\nelse in Fischer‚Äôs team. Indeed, by 5:00 P.M., while his teammates were\\nstill struggling down through the clouds at 28,000 feet, Boukreev was\\nalready in his tent resting and drinking tea. Experienced guides would\\nlater question his decision to descend so far ahead of his clients‚Äî\\nextremely unorthodox behavior for a guide. One of the clients from that\\ngroup has nothing but contempt for Boukreev, insisting that when it\\nmattered most, the guide ‚Äúcut and ran.‚Äù\\nAnatoli had left the summit around 2:00 P.M. and quickly became\\nentangled in the traffic jam at the Hillary Step. As soon as the mob\\ndispersed he moved very rapidly down the Southeast Ridge without\\nwaiting for any clients‚Äîdespite telling Fischer atop the Step that he\\nwould be going down with Martin Adams. Boukreev thereby arrived at\\nCamp Four well before the brunt of the storm.\\nAfter the expedition, when I asked Anatoli why he had hurried down\\nahead of his group, he handed me the transcript of an interview he‚Äôd\\ngiven a few days previously to \\nMen‚Äôs Journal\\n through a Russian\\ninterpreter. Boukreev told me that he‚Äôd read the transcript and\\nconfirmed its accuracy. Reading it on the spot, I quickly came to a series\\nof questions about the descent, to which he had replied:\\nI stayed [on the summit] for about an hour.‚Ä¶ It is very cold, naturally, it takes your\\nstrength.‚Ä¶ My position was that I would not \\nbe good if I stood around freezing, waiting. Iwould be more useful if I returned to Camp Four in order to be able to take oxygen up to the\\nreturning climbers or to go up to help them if some became weak during the descent.‚Ä¶ If\\nyou are immobile at that altitude you lose strength in the cold, and then you are unable to\\ndo anything.\\nBoukreev‚Äôs susceptibility to the cold was doubtless greatly exacerbated\\nby the fact that he wasn‚Äôt using supplemental oxygen; in the absence of\\ngas he simply couldn‚Äôt stop to wait for slow clients on the summit ridge\\nwithout courting frostbite and hypothermia. For whatever reason, he\\nraced down ahead of the group‚Äîwhich in fact had been his pattern\\nthroughout the entire expedition, as Fischer‚Äôs final letters and phone\\ncalls from Base Camp to Seattle made clear.\\nWhen I questioned him about the wisdom of leaving his clients on the\\nsummit ridge, Anatoli insisted that it was for the good of the team: ‚ÄúIt is\\nmuch better for me to warm myself at South Col, be ready to carry up\\noxygen if clients run out.‚Äù Indeed, shortly after dark, after Beidleman‚Äôs\\ngroup failed to return and the storm had risen to hurricane intensity,\\nBoukreev realized they must be in trouble and made a courageous\\nattempt to bring oxygen to them. But his stratagem had a serious flaw:\\nbecause neither he nor Beidleman had a radio, Anatoli had no way of\\nknowing the true nature of the missing climbers‚Äô predicament, or even\\nwhere on the huge expanse of the upper mountain they might be.\\nAround 7:30 P.M., Boukreev left Camp Four to search for the group,\\nregardless. By then, he recalled,\\nVisibility was maybe a meter. It disappeared altogether. I had a lamp, and I began to use\\noxygen to speed up my ascent. I was carrying three bottles. I tried to go faster, but visibility\\nwas gone.‚Ä¶ It is like being without eyes, without being able to see, it was impossible to see.\\nThat is very dangerous, because one can fall into a crevasse, one can fall toward the\\nsouthern side of Lhotse, 3,000 meters straight down. I tried to go up, it was dark, I could not\\nfind the fixed line.\\nSome six hundred feet above the Col, Boukreev recognized the futility of\\nhis effort and returned to the tents, but, he admits, he very nearly\\nbecame lost himself. In any case, it was just as well that he abandoned\\nthis rescue effort, because at that point his teammates were no longer on\\nthe peak above, where Boukreev had been headed‚Äîby the time he gaveup his search, Beidleman‚Äôs group was actually wandering around on the\\nCol six hundred feet \\nbelow\\n the Russian.\\nBoukreev arrived back at Camp Four around 9:00 P.M. Exhausted and\\nextremely concerned about his \\nmissing teammates, he sat down on his\\npack at the edge of camp, cradled his head in his hands, and tried to\\nfigure out how he might rescue them. ‚ÄúThe wind is driving snow into my\\nback but I am powerless to move,‚Äù he later recalled. ‚ÄúHow long I was\\nthere, I don‚Äôt remember. It is here that I start to lose track of time\\nbecause I am so tired, so exhausted.‚Äù\\nDuring one of Stuart Hutchison‚Äôs forays into the storm to look for the\\nmissing members of Rob Hall‚Äôs team, he was shocked to stumble upon\\nBoukreev sitting alone out in the blizzard. According to Hutchison,\\nBoukreev ‚Äúwas bent over, retching, about a hundred feet from the South\\nAfricans‚Äô tent. When I asked if he needed help, he answered, ‚ÄòNo! No!\\nNo!‚Äô He seemed in bad shape, really fucked out of his tree. So I brought\\nhim back to one of Fischer‚Äôs tents, and some Sherpas took him inside.‚Äù\\nBoukreev was worried sick about the nineteen climbers who were\\nmissing, but because he had no idea where they might be, there was\\nlittle he could do except warm himself, try to regain some strength, and\\nbide his time. Then, at 12:45 A.M., Beidleman, Groom, Schoening, and\\nGammelgaard hobbled into camp. ‚ÄúKlev and Neal had lost all power and\\ncould barely talk,‚Äù Boukreev recalls. ‚ÄúThey told me Charlotte, Sandy,\\nand Tim need help, Sandy is close to dying.

Beyond that, however, virtually nothing isknown about how the young guide met his end.\\nAt 6:00 A.M., Cotter asked Hall if the sun had reached him yet.\\n‚ÄúAlmost,‚Äù Rob replied‚Äîwhich was good, because he‚Äôd mentioned a\\nmoment earlier that he was shaking uncontrollably in the awful cold. In\\nconjunction with his earlier revelation that he was no longer able to\\nwalk, this had been very upsetting news to the people listening down\\nbelow. Nevertheless, it was remarkable that Hall was even alive after\\nspending a night without shelter or oxygen at 28,700 feet in hurricane-\\nforce winds and windchill of one hundred degrees below zero.\\nDuring this same radio call, Hall asked after Harris yet again: ‚ÄúDid\\nanyone see Harold last night except meself?‚Äù Some three hours later Rob\\nwas still obsessing over Andy‚Äôs whereabouts. At 8:43 A.M. he mused\\nover the radio, ‚ÄúSome of Andy‚Äôs gear is still here. I thought he must have\\ngone ahead in the nighttime. Listen, can you account for him or not?‚Äù\\nWilton attempted to dodge the question, but Rob \\npersisted in his line of\\ninquiry: ‚ÄúO.K. I mean his ice ax is here and his jacket and things.‚Äù\\n‚ÄúRob,‚Äù Viesturs replied from Camp Two, ‚Äúif you can put the jacket on,\\njust use it. Keep going down and worry only about yourself. Everybody\\nelse is taking care of other people. Just get yourself down.‚Äù\\nAfter struggling for four hours to de-ice his mask, Hall finally got it to\\nwork, and by 9:00 A.M. he was breathing supplemental oxygen for the\\nfirst time; by then he‚Äôd spent more than sixteen hours above 28,700 feet\\nwithout gas. Thousands of feet below, his friends stepped up their efforts\\nto cajole him to start down. ‚ÄúRob, this is Helen at Base Camp,‚Äù Wilton\\nimportuned, sounding as if she was on the brink of tears. ‚ÄúYou think\\nabout that little baby of yours. You‚Äôre going to see its face in a couple of\\nmonths, so keep on going.‚Äù\\nSeveral times Hall announced he was preparing to descend, and at one\\npoint we were sure he‚Äôd finally left the South Summit. At Camp Four,\\nLhakpa Chhiri and I shivered in the wind outside the tents, peering up at\\na tiny speck moving slowly down the upper Southeast Ridge. Convinced\\nthat it was Rob, coming down at last, Lhakpa and I slapped each other\\non the back and cheered him on. But an hour later my optimism was\\nrudely extinguished when I noticed that the speck was still in the same\\nplace: it was actually nothing but a rock‚Äîjust another altitude-inducedhallucination. In truth, Rob had never even left the South Summit.\\nAround 9:30 A.M., Ang Dorje and Lhakpa Chhiri left Camp Four and\\nstarted climbing toward the South Summit with a thermos of hot tea and\\ntwo extra canisters of oxygen, intending to rescue Hall. They faced an\\nexceedingly formidable task. As astounding and courageous as\\nBoukreev‚Äôs rescue of Sandy Pittman and Charlotte Fox had been the\\nnight before, it paled in comparison to what the two Sherpas were\\nproposing to do now: Pittman and Fox had been a twenty-minute walk\\nfrom the tents over relatively flat ground; Hall was 3,000 vertical feet\\nabove Camp Four‚Äîan exhausting eight-or nine-hour climb in the best of\\ncircumstances.\\nAnd these were surely not the best of circumstances. The wind was\\nblowing in excess of 40 knots. Both Ang Dorje and Lhakpa were cold and\\nwasted from climbing to the summit and back just the day before. If they\\ndid somehow manage to reach Hall, moreover, it would be late\\nafternoon before they got there, leaving only one or two hours of\\ndaylight in which to begin the even more difficult ordeal of bringing him\\ndown. Yet their loyalty to Hall was such that the two men ignored the\\noverwhelming odds and set out toward the South Summit as fast as they\\ncould climb.\\nShortly thereafter, two Sherpas from the Mountain Madness team‚Äî\\nTashi Tshering and Ngawang Sya Kya (a small, trim man, graying at the\\ntemples, who is Lopsang‚Äôs father)‚Äîand one Sherpa from the \\nTaiwanese\\nteam, Tenzing Nuri, headed up to bring down Scott Fischer and Makalu\\nGau. Twelve hundred feet above the South Col the trio of Sherpas found\\nthe incapacitated climbers on the ledge where Lopsang had left them.\\nAlthough they tried to give Fischer oxygen, he was unresponsive. Scott\\nwas still breathing, barely, but his eyes were fixed in their sockets, and\\nhis teeth were tightly clenched. Concluding that he was beyond hope,\\nthey left him on the ledge and started descending with Gau, who, after\\nreceiving hot tea and oxygen, and with considerable assistance from\\nTenzing Nuri, was able to move down to the tents on a short-rope under\\nhis own power.\\nThe day had started out sunny and clear, but the wind remainedfierce, and by late morning the upper mountain was wrapped in thick\\nclouds. Down at Camp Two the IMAX team reported that the wind over\\nthe summit sounded like a squadron of 747s, even from 7,000 feet\\nbelow. Meanwhile, high on the Southeast Ridge, Ang Dorje and Lhakpa\\nChhiri pressed on resolutely through the intensifying storm toward Hall.\\nAt 3:00 P.M., however, still 700 feet below the South Summit, the wind\\nand subzero cold proved to be too much for them, and the Sherpas could\\ngo no higher. It was a valiant effort, but it had failed‚Äîand as they\\nturned around to descend, Hall‚Äôs chances for survival all but vanished.\\nThroughout the day on May 11, his friends and teammates incessantly\\nbegged him to make an effort \\nto come down under his own power.\\nSeveral times Hall announced that he was preparing to descend, only to\\nchange his mind and remain immobile at the South Summit. At 3:20\\nP.M., Cotter‚Äîwho by now had walked over from his own camp beneath\\nPumori to the Everest Base Camp‚Äîscolded over the radio, ‚ÄúRob, get\\nmoving down the ridge.‚Äù\\nSounding annoyed, Hall fired back, ‚ÄúLook, if I thought I could manage\\nthe knots on the fixed ropes with me frostbitten hands, I would have\\ngone down six hours ago, pal. Just send a couple of the boys up with a\\nbig thermos of something hot‚Äîthen I‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù\\n‚ÄúThing is, mate, the lads who went up today encountered some high\\nwinds and had to turn around,‚Äù Cotter replied, trying to convey as\\ndelicately as possible that the rescue attempt had been abandoned, ‚Äúso\\nwe think your best shot is to move lower.‚Äù\\n‚ÄúI can last another night here if you send up a couple of boys with\\nsome Sherpa tea, first thing in the morning, no later than nine-thirty or\\nten,‚Äù Rob answered.\\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a tough man, Big Guy,‚Äù said Cotter, his voice quavering.\\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôll send some boys up to you in the morning.‚Äù\\nAt 6:20 P.M., Cotter contacted Hall to tell him that Jan Arnold was on\\nthe satellite phone from Christchurch and was waiting to be patched\\nthrough. ‚ÄúGive me a minute,‚Äù Rob said. ‚ÄúMe mouth‚Äôs dry. I want to eat a\\nbit of snow before I talk to her.‚Äù A little later he came back on and\\nrasped in a slow, horribly \\ndistorted voice, ‚ÄúHi, my sweetheart. I hope\\nyou‚Äôre tucked up in a nice warm bed. How are you doing?‚Äù‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell you how much I‚Äôm thinking about you!‚Äù Arnold replied.\\n‚ÄúYou sound so much better than I expected.‚Ä¶ Are you warm, my\\ndarling?‚Äù\\n‚ÄúIn the context of the altitude, the setting, I‚Äôm reasonably\\ncomfortable,‚Äù Hall answered, doing his best not to alarm her.\\n‚ÄúHow are your feet?‚Äù\\n‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken me boots off to check, but I think I may have a bit of\\nfrostbite.‚Ä¶ ‚Äù\\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward to making you completely better when you come\\nhome,‚Äù said Arnold. ‚ÄúI just know you‚Äôre going to be rescued. Don‚Äôt feel\\nthat you‚Äôre alone. I‚Äôm sending all my positive energy your way!‚Äù\\nBefore signing off, Hall told his wife, ‚ÄúI love you. Sleep well, my\\nsweetheart. Please don‚Äôt worry too much.‚Äù\\nThese would be the last words anyone would hear him speak.\\nAttempts to make radio contact with Hall later that night and the next\\nday went unanswered. Twelve days later, when Breashears and Viesturs\\nclimbed over the South Summit on their way to the top, they found Hall\\nlying on his right side in a shallow ice hollow, his upper body buried\\nbeneath a drift of snow.\\n*\\n It wasn‚Äôt until I interviewed Lopsang in Seattle on July 25, 1996, that I learned he had seen\\nHarris on the evening of May 10. Although I‚Äôd spoken briefly with Lopsang several times\\npreviously, I‚Äôd never thought to ask whether he‚Äôd encountered Harris on the South Summit,\\nbecause at that point I was still certain I‚Äôd seen Harris at the South Col, 3,000 feet below the\\nSouth Summit, at 6:30 P.M. Moreover, Guy Cotter \\nhad\\n asked Lopsang if he‚Äôd seen Harris, and\\nfor some reason‚Äîperhaps a simple misunderstanding of the question‚Äîon that occasion\\nLopsang said no.\\n*\\n Early the next morning while searching the Col for Andy Harris, I came across Lopsang‚Äôs faint\\ncrampon tracks in the ice leading up from the lip of the Lhotse Face, and mistakenly believed\\nthey were Harris‚Äôs tracks headed \\ndown\\n the face‚Äîwhich is why I thought Harris had walked off\\nthe edge of the Col.\\n*\\n I‚Äôd already reported with absolute certainty that I‚Äôd seen Harris on the South Col at 6:30 P.M.,\\nMay 10. When Hall said that Harris was with him up on the South Summit‚Äî3,000 feet higher\\nthan where I said I‚Äôd seen him‚Äîmost people, thanks to my error, wrongly assumed that Hall‚Äôsstatements were merely the incoherent ramblings of an exhausted, severely hypoxic man.A\\nEIGHTEEN\\nNORTHEAST RIDGE'\n",

            " page_content='single-season death toll since climbers first set foot on the peak seventy-\\nfive years ago.Of the six climbers on Hall‚Äôs expedition who reached the summit, only\\nMike Groom and I made it back down: four teammates with whom I‚Äôd\\nlaughed and vomited and held long, intimate conversations lost their\\nlives. My actions‚Äîor failure to act‚Äîplayed a direct role in the death of\\nAndy Harris. And while Yasuko Namba lay dying on the South Col, I was\\na mere 350 yards away, huddled inside a tent, oblivious to her struggle,\\nconcerned only with my own safety. The stain this has left on my psyche\\nis not the sort of thing that washes off after a few months of grief and\\nguilt-ridden self-reproach.\\nEventually I spoke of my lingering disquietude to Klev Schoening,\\nwhose home was not far from mine. Klev said that he, too, felt awful\\nabout the loss of so many lives, but unlike me, he had no ‚Äúsurvivor‚Äôs\\nguilt.‚Äù He explained, ‚ÄúOut on the Col that night, I used up everything I\\nhad trying to save myself and the people with me. By the time we made\\nit back to the tents I had absolutely nothing left. I‚Äôd frostbitten one\\ncornea and was practically blind. I was hypothermic, delirious, and\\nshivering uncontrollably. It was terrible losing Yasuko, but I‚Äôve made\\npeace with myself over it, because I know in my heart that there \\nwas\\nnothing more I could have done to save her. You shouldn‚Äôt be so hard on\\nyourself. It was a bad storm. In the condition you were in at the time,\\nwhat could you have possibly done for her?‚Äù\\nPerhaps nothing, I concurred. But in contrast to Schoening, I‚Äôll never\\nbe sure. And the enviable peace of which he speaks eludes me.\\nWith so many marginally qualified climbers flocking to Everest these\\ndays, a lot of people believe that a tragedy of this magnitude was\\noverdue. But nobody imagined that an expedition led by Rob Hall would\\nbe at the center of it. Hall ran the tightest, safest operation on the\\nmountain, bar none. A compulsively methodical man, he had elaborate\\nsystems in place that were supposed to prevent such a catastrophe. So\\nwhat happened? How can it be explained, not only to the loved ones left\\nbehind, but to a censorious public?\\nHubris probably had something to do with it. Hall had become so\\nadept at running climbers of all abilities up and down Everest that he got\\na little cocky, perhaps. He‚Äôd bragged on more than one occasion that hecould get almost any reasonably fit person to the summit, and his record\\nseemed to support this. He‚Äôd also demonstrated a remarkable ability to\\nprevail over adversity.\\nIn 1995, for instance, Hall and his guides not only had to cope with\\nHansen‚Äôs problems high on the peak, but they also had to deal with the\\ncomplete collapse \\nof another client named Chantal Mauduit, a celebrated\\nFrench alpinist who was making her seventh stab at Everest without\\noxygen. Mauduit passed out stone cold at 28,700 feet and had to be\\ndragged and carried all the way down from the South Summit to the\\nSouth Col ‚Äúlike a sack of spuds,‚Äù as Guy Cotter put it. After everybody\\ncame out of that summit attempt alive, Hall may well have thought\\nthere was little he couldn‚Äôt handle.\\nBefore this year, however, Hall had had uncommonly good luck with\\nthe weather, and it might have skewed his judgment. ‚ÄúSeason after\\nseason,‚Äù confirmed David Breashears, who has been on more than a\\ndozen Himalayan expeditions and has himself climbed Everest three\\ntimes, ‚ÄúRob had brilliant weather on summit day. He‚Äôd never been\\ncaught by a storm high on the mountain.‚Äù In fact, the gale of May 10,\\nthough violent, was nothing extraordinary; it was a fairly typical Everest\\nsquall. If it had hit two hours later, it‚Äôs likely that nobody would have\\ndied. Conversely, if it had arrived even one hour earlier, the storm could\\neasily have killed eighteen or twenty climbers‚Äîme among them.\\nCertainly time had as much to do with the tragedy as the weather, and\\nignoring the clock can‚Äôt be passed off as an act of God. Delays at the\\nfixed lines were foreseeable and eminently preventable. Predetermined\\nturn-around times were egregiously ignored.\\nExtending the turn-around times may have been influenced to some\\ndegree by the rivalry between \\nFischer and Hall. Fischer had never\\nguided Everest before 1996. From a business standpoint, there was\\ntremendous pressure on him to be successful. He was exceedingly\\nmotivated to get clients to the summit, especially a celebrity client like\\nSandy Hill Pittman.\\nLikewise, since he had failed to get anybody to the top in 1995, it\\nwould have been bad for Hall‚Äôs business if he failed again in 1996‚Äî\\nespecially if Fischer succeeded. Scott had a charismatic personality, andthat charisma had been aggressively marketed by Jane Bromet. Fischer\\nwas trying very hard to eat Hall‚Äôs lunch, and Rob knew it. Under the\\ncircumstances, the prospect of turning his clients around while his rival‚Äôs\\nclients were pushing toward the summit may have been sufficiently\\ndistasteful to cloud Hall‚Äôs judgment.\\nIt can‚Äôt be stressed strongly enough, moreover, that Hall, Fischer, and\\nthe rest of us were forced to make such critical decisions while severely\\nimpaired with hypoxia. In pondering how this disaster could have\\noccurred, it is imperative to remember that lucid thought is all but\\nimpossible at 29,000 feet.\\nWisdom comes easily after the fact. Shocked by the toll in human life,\\ncritics have been quick to suggest policies and procedures to ensure that\\nthe catastrophes of this season won‚Äôt be repeated. It has been proposed,\\nfor example that a guide-to-client ratio of one to one be established as\\nthe standard on Everest‚Äîi.e., each client would climb with his or her\\nown personal guide and remain roped to that guide at all times.\\nPerhaps the simplest way to reduce future carnage \\nwould be to ban\\nbottled oxygen except for emergency medical use. A few reckless souls\\nmight perish trying to reach the summit without gas, but the great bulk\\nof marginally competent climbers would be forced to turn back by their\\nown physical limitations before they ascended high enough to get into\\nserious trouble. And a no-gas regulation would have the corollary benefit\\nof automatically reducing trash and crowding because considerably\\nfewer people would attempt Everest if they knew supplemental oxygen\\nwas not an option.\\nBut guiding Everest is a very loosely regulated business, administered\\nby byzantine Third World bureaucracies spectacularly ill-equipped to\\nassess qualifications of guides or clients. Moreover, the two nations that\\ncontrol access to the peak‚ÄîNepal and China‚Äîare staggeringly poor.\\nDesperate for hard currency, the governments of both countries have a\\nvested interest in issuing as many expensive climbing permits as the\\nmarket will support, and both are unlikely to enact any policies that\\nsignificantly limit their revenues.\\nAnalyzing what went wrong on Everest is a useful enough enterprise;\\nit might conceivably prevent some deaths down the road. But to believethat dissecting the tragic events of 1996 in minute detail will actually\\nreduce the future death rate in any meaningful way is wishful thinking.\\nThe urge to catalog the myriad blunders in order to ‚Äúlearn from the\\nmistakes‚Äù is for the most part an exercise in denial and self-deception. If\\nyou can convince yourself that Rob Hall died because he made a string\\nof stupid errors and that you are too clever to repeat those same errors,\\nit makes it easier for you to attempt Everest in the face of some rather\\ncompelling evidence that doing so is injudicious.\\nIn fact, the murderous outcome of 1996 was in many ways simply\\nbusiness as usual. Although a record number of people died in the spring\\nclimbing season on Everest, the 12 fatalities amounted to only 3 percent\\nof the 398 climbers who ascended higher than Base Camp‚Äîwhich is\\nactually slightly below the historical fatality rate of 3.3 percent. Or\\nhere‚Äôs another way to look at it: between 1921 and May 1996, 144\\npeople died and the peak was climbed some 630 times‚Äîa ratio of one in\\nfour. Last spring, 12 climbers died and 84 reached the summit‚Äîa ratio\\nof one in seven. Compared to these historical standards, 1996 was\\nactually a safer-than-average year.\\nTruth be told, climbing Everest has always been an extraordinarily\\ndangerous undertaking and doubtless always will be, whether the people\\ninvolved are Himalayan neophytes being guided up the peak or world-\\nclass mountaineers climbing with their peers. It is worth noting that\\nbefore the mountain claimed the lives of Hall and Fischer, it had already\\nwiped out a whole corps of elite climbers, including Peter Boardman,\\nJoe Tasker, Matty Hoey, Jake Breitenbach, Mick Burke, Michel\\nParmentier, Roger Marshall, Ray Genet, and George Leigh Mallory.\\nIn the case of the guided ilk, it rapidly became \\nclear to me in 1996\\nthat few of the clients on the peak (myself included) truly appreciated\\nthe gravity of the risks we faced‚Äîthe thinness of the margin by which\\nhuman life is sustained above 25,000 feet. Walter Mittys with Everest\\ndreams need to bear in mind that when things go wrong up in the Death\\nZone‚Äîand sooner or later they always do‚Äîthe strongest guides in the\\nworld may be powerless to save a client‚Äôs life; indeed, as the events of\\n1996 demonstrated, the strongest guides in the world are sometimes\\npowerless to save even their own lives. Four of my teammates died not\\nso much because Rob Hall‚Äôs systems were faulty‚Äîindeed, nobody‚Äôs werebetter‚Äîbut because on Everest it is the nature of systems to break down\\nwith a vengeance.\\nIn the midst of all the postmortem ratiocination, it is easy to lose sight\\nof the fact that climbing mountains will never be a safe, predictable,\\nrule-bound enterprise. This is an activity that idealizes risk-taking; the\\nsport‚Äôs most celebrated figures have always been those who stick their\\nnecks out the farthest and manage to get away with it. Climbers, as a\\nspecies, are simply not distinguished by an excess of prudence. And that\\nholds especially true for Everest climbers: when presented with a chance'\n",

In any\\ncase, Beidleman was sufficiently disenchanted with the book that in\\nDecember 1997 he wrote a letter to DeWalt stating, ‚ÄúI think that \\nThe\\nClimb\\n is a dishonest account of the May tragedy.‚Ä¶ [N]either you nor\\nyour associates once called to fact-check a single detail with me.‚Äù\\nOwing to DeWalt‚Äôs haphazard research, errors abound in \\nThe Climb\\n. To\\ncite but one example: Andy Harris‚Äôs ice ax‚Äîthe location of which\\nprovides an important clue about how Harris might have died‚Äîwas notfound where DeWalt reported that it was found. This was one of the\\nmany errors I pointed out to DeWalt and his editors upon publication of\\nthe first edition of \\nThe Climb\\n in November 1997, yet it was still incorrect\\nin the paperback edition published some seven months later.\\nAstoundingly, this error remains uncorrected in the extensively revised\\npaper back edition published in July 1999‚Äîdespite DeWalt‚Äôs printed\\nassurances to the contrary.\\n*\\n Such indifference is vexing to those of us\\nwho were transformed by the disaster, and are still consumed with\\ntrying to sort out what really happened up there. Andy Harris‚Äôs family\\ncertainly does not consider the matter of where his ice ax was found to\\nbe an inconsequential detail.\\nSadly, some of the errors in \\nThe Climb\\n do not appear to be the product\\nof mere carelessness, but rather to be deliberate distortions of the truth\\nintended to discredit my reporting in \\nInto Thin Air\\n. For instance, DeWalt\\nreports in \\nThe Climb\\n that important details in my \\nOutside\\n magazine\\narticle weren‚Äôt fact-checked, even though he was aware that an \\nOutside\\neditor named John Alderman met with Boukreev at length and in person\\nat the magazine‚Äôs offices in Santa Fe specifically to confirm the accuracy\\nof my entire manuscript before publication of the magazine.\\nAdditionally, I, personally, had several conversations over a period of\\ntwo months with Boukreev in which I made every effort to discern the\\ntruth.\\nThe Boukreev/DeWalt version of events does indeed differ from the\\nversion that I found to be true, but \\nOutside\\n published what the editors\\nand I believed to be the factual version, rather than Boukreev‚Äôs version.\\nOver the course of my numerous interviews with Anatoli, I discovered\\nthat his account of important events changed significantly from one\\ntelling to the next, forcing me to doubt the accuracy of his memory. And\\nAnatoli‚Äôs versions of certain events were subsequently proven to be\\nuntrue by other witnesses, most notably Dale Kruse, Klev Schoening,\\nLopsang Jangbu, Martin Adams, and Neal Beidleman (of whom DeWalt\\ninterviewed only Adams). In short, I found many of Anatoli‚Äôs\\nrecollections to be singularly unreliable.\\nIn \\nThe Climb\\n and elsewhere, DeWalt has suggested that in writing \\nInto\\nThin Air\\n my intent was to destroy Anatoli Boukreev‚Äôs good name. To\\nsupport this despicable imputation, DeWalt relies on two complaints: 1) Ididn‚Äôt mention a purported conversation above the Hillary Step between\\nBoukreev and Scott Fischer in which Fischer allegedly gave Boukreev\\npermission to descend ahead of his clients; and 2) I refused to\\nacknowledge that Fischer supposedly had a predetermined plan in place\\nfor Boukreev to descend ahead of his clients.\\nRegarding the first of these complaints, this is what I know to be true\\nabout the conversation between Fischer and Boukreev atop the Hillary\\nStep: Boukreev, Martin Adams, Andy Harris, and I were waiting together\\nabove the Step when an obviously ailing Fischer arrived on his way to\\nthe summit. Fischer first exchanged a few words with Adams, then had\\nan even shorter conversation with Boukreev. As Adams remembers this\\nlatter conversation, Boukreev told Fischer, ‚ÄúI am going down with\\nMartin,‚Äù and said nothing more. These six words comprised the full\\nextent of their discussion, after which Fischer spoke briefly with me,\\nthen turned his back on all of us and resumed his plod toward the\\nsummit. Boukreev later insisted that after Harris, Adams, and I had left\\nthe scene, he and Fischer had a second conversation in which Fischer\\ngave him permission to descend ahead of his clients in order to make tea\\nfor them and provide ‚Äúsupport below.‚Äù\\nIn the weeks and months immediately following the Everest disaster,\\nAdams‚ÄîBoukreev‚Äôs close friend and one of his fiercest defenders‚Äîtold\\nme, Neal Beidleman, and others that he doubted that this second\\nconversation actually occurred. Since then he has revised his position\\nsomewhat: Adams‚Äôs latest stance is that he has no idea whether or not\\nthere was a second conversation between Fischer and Boukreev, because\\nhe wasn‚Äôt present when it was alleged to have taken place.\\nObviously, I wasn‚Äôt present, either. So why do I doubt Anatoli‚Äôs\\nmemory of a second conversation? Partly because the first time\\nBoukreev told me about having a long discussion in which Fischer\\nencouraged him to descend ahead of his clients, Boukreev clearly stated\\nthat it occurred when Fischer first arrived atop the Hillary Step‚Äîwhen\\nAdams, Harris, and I were present. Later, after I pointed out that Adams\\nremembered this conversation very differently, Anatoli changed his\\nstory: now he said he‚Äôd had a second conversation with Fischer after\\nAdams, Harris, and I had descended.\\nMy main reason for doubting the second conversation, however,comes from what I saw as I began heading down the Hillary Step: as I\\nlooked up one last time to check the rappel anchors before descending, I\\nnoticed that Fischer had already moved well above the small staging\\narea where Harris, Adams, Boukreev, and I had congregated to clip into\\nthe rappel ropes. Am I certain that Boukreev didn‚Äôt climb \\nback up to\\nFischer and have a second conversation with him? No. But Anatoli, like\\nthe rest of us, was very cold and tired, and exceedingly anxious to get\\ndown. As I rappelled over the lip of the Step, Anatoli was shivering\\nimpatiently on the narrow ridge crest immediately above me; it‚Äôs hard\\nfor me to conceive of what would have prompted him to climb back up\\nand have another discussion with Fischer.\\nThus I have reason to be skeptical that a second conversation between\\nFischer and Boukreev occurred. Nevertheless, in retrospect, to be fair to\\nBoukreev I should have reported his recollection of a second\\nconversation and then explained why I doubted it, rather than make no\\nmention of it at all in my book. I regret the hard feelings and sharp\\nwords that have resulted.\\nI am puzzled, however, as to why DeWalt has expressed such outrage\\nover my decision not to report this disputed second conversation, while\\nat the same time he saw no reason, in \\nThe Climb\\n, to report the first\\nconversation between Fischer and Boukreev‚Äîa conversation about\\nwhich there is absolutely no argument: Boukreev told Fischer he was\\n‚Äúgoing down with Martin.‚Äù Although Adams has expressed the view that\\nI wasn‚Äôt in a position to overhear these words when they were spoken,\\nhe has never disputed that this brief declaration is precisely what Anatoli\\nsaid. But in the version of events presented by DeWalt in \\nThe Climb\\n, this\\nconversation simply didn‚Äôt occur. It should be noted, moreover, that\\nBoukreev‚Äôs failure to stay with \\nAdams during the descent, as he told\\nFischer he would, nearly cost Adams his life.\\nIn his book, \\nSheer Will\\n, Michael Groom described the moment when\\nhe, Yasuko Namba, and I encountered Adams as we made our way down\\ntoward the Balcony at 27,600 feet. Adams, according to Groom, ‚Äúwas in\\nan uncontrolled tumble off to our left. From where I stood he looked out\\nof control and in no hurry to regain it.‚Äù Groom met up with Adams again\\nlower down, after his tumble had somehow ended. Adams wasonly just getting to his feet ‚Ä¶ veering dangerously close to the wrong side of the mountain\\nin a series of drunken flops into the snow, one of which could end up over the edge in Tibet.\\nI detoured off my path to get close enough to speak with him. I could see that his oxygen\\nmask had slipped off beneath his chin and clumps of ice hung from his eyebrows and chin.\\nLying half-buried in the snow, he was giggling‚Äîthe result of oxygen debt to the brain. I told\\nhim to pull his oxygen mask over his mouth. In a fatherly sort of manner I then coaxed him\\ncloser and closer to the ridge crest.‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúNow, see those two climbers down there in red? Just\\nfollow them,‚Äù I said, pointing to Jon and Yasuko still visible in the gully below. He stepped\\noff the ridge in such a haphazard manner, I wondered whether he cared if he lived or \\ndied.\\nConcerned about his judgment, I decided to stick with him.\\nIf Groom hadn‚Äôt happened upon Adams‚Äîwho was completely\\ndisoriented after being left behind by Boukreev‚Äîit seems likely that\\nAdams would have continued down the wrong side of the mountain and\\ndied. Yet none of this is reported in \\nThe Climb\\n.\\nPerhaps the most disturbing misrepresentation in \\nThe Climb\\n concerns a\\nconversation between Scott Fischer and Jane Bromet (Fischer‚Äôs publicist\\nand confidant, who accompanied him to Base Camp). Bromet, offering\\nher memory of this conversation, is quoted by DeWalt in a manner\\nintended to convince readers that Fischer had a predetermined plan in\\nplace for Boukreev to descend quickly after reaching the summit, ahead\\nof his clients. This edited quote forms the basis of DeWalt‚Äôs second major\\nallegation: that my failure to mention the purported plan in \\nInto Thin Air\\nwas a nefarious ‚Äúassassination of character for which, after the fact, I do\\nnot believe there is a justifiable defense.‚Äù\\nActually, I didn‚Äôt mention this so-called plan because I found\\ncompelling evidence that no such plan existed. Beidleman‚Äîwho is\\nwidely respected for his quiet humility, his honesty, and his strength and\\nexperience as a mountaineer‚Äîtold me that if such a plan were in place,\\nhe definitely wasn‚Äôt aware of it when the Mountain Madness team went'\n",

            "Summary: Napoleon Bonaparte (born Napoleone di Buonaparte; 15 August 1769 ‚Äì 5 May 1821), later known by his regnal name Napoleon I, was a French emperor and military commander who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. He was the leader of the French Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804, then of the French Empire as Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and briefly again in 1815. His political and cultural legacy endures as a celebrated and controversial leader. He initiated many enduring reforms, but has been criticized for his authoritarian rule. He is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history and his wars and campaigns are still studied at military schools worldwide. However, historians still debate whether he was responsible for the Napoleonic Wars in which between three and six million people died.Napoleon was born on the island of Corsica into a family descended from Italian nobility. He was resentful of the French monarchy, and supported the French Revolution in 1789 while serving in the French army, trying to spread its ideals to his native Corsica. He rose rapidly in the ranks after saving the governing French Directory by firing on royalist insurgents. In 1796, he began a military campaign against the Austrians and their Italian allies, scoring decisive victories, and became a national hero. Two years later he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power. He engineered a coup in November 1799 and became First Consul of the Republic. In 1804, to consolidate and expand his power, he crowned himself Emperor of the French.\n",
            "Differences with the United Kingdom meant France faced the War of the Third Coalition by 1805. Napoleon shattered this coalition with victories in the Ulm campaign and at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him. Napoleon defeated Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, marched the Grande Arm√©e into Eastern Europe, and defeated the Russians in June 1807 at Friedland, forcing the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to accept the Treaties of Tilsit. Two years later, the Austrians challenged the French again during the War of the Fifth Coalition, but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram.\n",
            "Hoping to extend the Continental System, his embargo against Britain, Napoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsula and declared his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted in the Peninsular War aided by a British army, culminating in defeat for Napoleon's marshals. Napoleon launched an invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812. The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic retreat of Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France, resulting in a large coalition army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig. The coalition invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. He was exiled to the island of Elba, between Corsica and Italy. In France, the Bourbons were restored to power.\n",
            "Napoleon escaped in February 1815 and took control of France. The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. The British exiled him to the remote island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic, where he died in 1821 at the age of 51.\n",
            "Napoleon had a lasting impact on the world, bringing modernizing reforms to France and Western Europe and stimulating the development of nation states. He also sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States in 1803, doubling the latter's size. However, his mixed record on civil rights and exploitation of conquered territories adversely affect his reputation.\n",

            "Summary: Serena Jameka Williams (born September 26, 1981) is an American former professional tennis player. Widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time, she was ranked world No. 1 in singles by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) for 319 weeks, including a joint-record 186 consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. She won 23 Grand Slam women's singles titles, the most in the Open Era, and the second-most of all time. She is the only player to accomplish a career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles.Along with her elder sister Venus, Serena Williams was coached by her parents Oracene Price and Richard Williams. Turning professional in 1995, she won her first major singles title at the 1999 US Open. From the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open, she was dominant, winning all four major singles titles (each time over Venus in the final) to achieve a non-calendar year Grand Slam and the career Grand Slam, known as the 'Serena Slam'. The next few years saw her claim two more singles majors, but suffer from injury and decline in form. Beginning in 2007, however, she gradually returned to form despite continued injuries, retaking the world No. 1 singles ranking. Beginning at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, Williams returned to dominance, claiming Olympic gold (completing the Career Golden Slam in singles) and winning eight out of thirteen singles majors, including all four in a row from 2014‚Äì15 to achieve a second \"Serena Slam\". At the 2017 Australian Open, she won her 23rd major singles title, surpassing Steffi Graf's Open Era record. She then took a break from professional tennis after becoming pregnant and reached four major finals upon returning to play. In August 2022, Williams announced her impending \"evolution\" away from professional tennis and played what was expected to be her final match at the 2022 US Open.Williams also won 14 major women's doubles titles, all with her sister Venus, and the pair was unbeaten in major doubles finals (the best unbeaten record in major finals in any discipline of the sport). The pair achieved a non-calendar year Grand Slam between the 2009 Wimbledon Championships and the 2010 French Open, which granted the sisters the doubles world No. 1 ranking. Serena won four Olympic gold medals, three in women's doubles‚Äîan all-time joint record in tennis, shared with her sister. The duo are the only women in the Open Era to win Olympic gold in both singles and doubles. She also won two major mixed doubles titles, both in 1998. She is the only singles player, male or female, to complete three Career Golden Slams ‚Äì one in women's singles and two in same-sex doubles.The arrival of the Williams sisters has been credited with ushering in a new era of power and athleticism on the women's professional tennis tour. Serena holds a combined 39 major titles: 23 in singles, 14 in women's doubles, and two in mixed doubles. She is joint-third on the all-time list and second in the Open Era for total major titles. She is the most recent woman to simultaneously hold all four major singles titles (2002‚Äì03 and 2014‚Äì15), and the most recent woman to win the Surface Slam (major titles on hard, clay and grass courts in the same calendar year), doing so in 2015. She is also, with Venus, the most recent player to have simultaneously held all four major women's doubles titles (2009‚Äì10).\n",
            "Williams was the world's highest paid woman athlete in 2016, earning almost $29 million. She repeated this feat in 2017 when she was the only woman on Forbes' list of the 100 highest-paid athletes, with $27 million in prize money and endorsements. She won the Laureus Sportswoman of the Year award a record four times (2003, 2010, 2016, 2018), and in December 2015 was named Sportsperson of the Year by Sports Illustrated magazine. She is the highest-earning woman athlete of all time.\n",
